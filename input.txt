Intracontinental deformation accommodated along major lithospheric scale shear zone systems and
within associated extensional basins has been well documented within West, Central and East Africa during the Late Cretaceous. The nature of this deformation has been established by studies of the tectonic
architecture of sedimentary basins preserved in this part of Africa. In southern Africa, where the post
break-up history has been dominated by major erosion, little evidence for post-break-up tectonics has
been preserved in the onshore geology. Here we present the results of 38 new apatite ssion track analyses from the Damara region of northern Namibia and integrate these new data with our previous results
that were focused on specic regions or sections only to comprehensively document the thermo-tectonic
history of this region since continental break-up in the Early Cretaceous. The apatite ssion track ages
range from 449  20 Ma to 59  3 Ma, with mean conned track lengths between 14.61  0.1 lm (SD
0.95 lm) to 10.83  0.33 lm (SD 2.84 lm). The youngest ages (c. 8060 Ma) yield the longest mean track
lengths, and combined with their spatial distribution, indicate major cooling during the latest Cretaceous.
A simple numerical thermal model is used to demonstrate that this cooling is consistent with the combined effects of heating caused by magmatic underplating, related to the Paran-Etendeka continental
ood volcanism associated with rifting and the opening of the South Atlantic, and enhanced erosion
caused by major reactivation of major lithospheric structures within southern Africa during a key period
of plate kinematic change that occurred in the South Atlantic and SW Indian ocean basins between 87 and
56 Ma. This phase of intraplate tectonism in northern Namibia, focused in discrete structurally dened
zones, is coeval with similar phases elsewhere in Africa and suggests some form of trans-continental linkage between these lithospheric zones.

1. Introduction
The inuence of pre-existing lithospheric structure on the
geometry and location of intra-continental rifting, associated with
the development of the Atlantic Ocean, has been particularly well
documented by studies in northeastern Brazil and in West, Central
and East Africa (e.g. Burke and Dewey, 1974; Burke, 1976a, 1976b;
McConnel, 1980; Pindell and Dewey, 1982; Fairhead and Okereke,
1987; Fairhead, 1988; Unternehr et al., 1988; Snant and Popoff,

McHargue et al., 1992; Maurin and Guiraud, 1993; Winn et al.,
1993; Loule and Pospisil, 2012). These studies have highlighted
the genetic relationship between the tectonic development of
intracontinental rift basins, within Africa and South America, and
changes in the nature and geometry of the surrounding plate
boundaries, in particular those associated with the development
of the North and Central Atlantic Ocean basins, from their initiation
during the Late Triassic (e.g. Manspeizer, 1988; Torsvik et al., 2009)
through to the present (Blundell, 1976).
Two Late Mesozoic tectonic episodes, characterised by major
intracontinental deformation involving rifting and basin inversion,
have been identied within West, Central and East Africa; one during the Early Cretaceous (130 Ma) associated with continental

break-up and onset of sea oor spreading between Africa and
South America and a second during the Late Cretaceous (75
80 Ma), associated with a major change in the spreading geometry
within the Central and South Atlantic Oceans (Klitgord and
Schouten, 1986; Cande et al., 1988; Fairhead, 1988; Shaw and
Cande, 1990; Dypvik et al., 1990; Binks and Fairhead, 1992;
Bosworth, 1992; Fairhead and Binks, 1991; Guiraud and Maurin,
1992; Guiraud et al., 1992). Recognition of these Late Mesozoic episodes of tectonism, in West and Central Africa, was made possible
largely by the sedimentary sequences, preserved within the intracontinental rift basins, providing a record of the basins tectonic
history. However, the paucity of Late Mesozoic and Tertiary age
rocks preserved within southern Africa has prohibited any detailed
study of the post-Gondwana (Late Mesozoic-Tertiary) tectonic
development of this region.
Given this situation, apatite ssion track analysis (AFTA) offers a
unique opportunity for studying the Late Mesozoic and Tertiary
tectonic and geomorphic history of southern Africa due to the techniques ability to document the low temperature (<125 C) thermal history of the crust (Brown et al., 1994a; Gallagher et al., 1998;
Gleadow and Brown, 2000; Reiners et al., 2005; Reiners and
Brandon, 2006). Signicantly, AFTA results from the rift-margin
of the Anza graben in Central Kenya (Foster and Gleadow, 1992,
1993, 1996) document at least two discrete pulses of denudational

21

cooling of the crust; one during the Early Cretaceous and a later
episode during the Late CretaceousPalaeocene. The 38 new AFTA
data reported here record a very similar chronology of shallow
crustal cooling to that in Central Kenya, and when integrated with
our earlier data (Raab et al., 2002, 2005) from this region provide
strong support for the concept of a distinct tectonic episode affecting the interior of northern Namibia during the Late Cretaceous.
The coincidence between this proposed period of tectonism in
southwestern Africa and the Late Cretaceous episode identied in
West, Central and East Africa (e.g. Fairhead, 1988; Fairhead and
Binks, 1991; Binks and Fairhead, 1992), combined with the regional structural setting provides compelling evidence for a Late Cretaceous, trans-African (neo-Pan-African) intracontinental tectonic
episode. In this paper we report the new AFTA results and an integrated interpretation including previously published apatite ssion
track age data (Haack, 1976, 1983; Raab et al., 2002, 2005).

Damara metamorphic belt (Tankard et al., 1982; Martin and Eder,
1983; Miller, 1983) which forms part of the interconnected system
of the 500 Ma Pannotios (Stump, 1992) (Pan African of Africa,
Delamarian of Australia, Ross of Antarctica, Brasiliano of South
America) mobile belts which surround many of the cratonic terrains within Africa (Fig. 2) (Kennedy, 1964; Barton and Key,
1981; Krner, 1977; Daly et al., 1989; Kampunzu et al., 1991;
Light, 1982). The Damara metamorphic belt consists of two lithologically and structurally continuous branches; a 400500 km
wide intracontinental branch which trends NESW which separates the composite Zaire and Kalahari cratonic terrains, and a
coastal branch which parallels the present Atlantic margin, trending NNWSSE. The intracontinental branch of the Damara metamorphic belt forms the westerly extension of the Precambrian
trans-continental Mwembeshi shear zone (Coward and Daly,
1984) has had a profound inuence on the Phanerozoic geological
history of central and southern Africa (e.g. Castaing, 1991; Daly
et al., 1989, 1991; Maurin and Guiraud, 1993; Ring et al., 2002).
The site and geometry of continental rifting, and the associated
Etendeka magmatism, leading ultimately to the opening of the
South Atlantic Ocean basin, appears also to have been inuenced
by the pre-existing crustal structure (e.g. Erlank, 1984; Porada,
1989). These intracontinental structures apparently also determined the location of many of the major oceanic transform faults
and resultant fracture zones (Le Pichon and Fox, 1971; Fuller,
1971, 1972; Francheteau and Le Pichon, 1972; Sykes, 1978), as well
as the locus of alkaline magmatism in southern Africa and southeastern Brazil (Marsh, 1973; Moore, 1976).
Most pre-rift plate reconstructions for South America and Africa
(Rabinowitz and La Brecque, 1979; Keith Martin et al., 1981;

Martin, 1984, 1987; OConnor and Duncan, 1990; Nrnberg and
Mller, 1991; OConnor and le Roex, 1992; Torsvik et al., 2009;
Aslanian et al., 2009; Aslanian and Moulin, 2012) place northern
Namibia within the predicted region of inuence of the Tristan
da Cunha mantle plume during the Early Cretaceous. Lithospheric
extension and thinning over this region of anomalously hot mantle
has been invoked as the cause of the ParanEtendeka ood basalt
province (White and McKenzie, 1989; Peate et al., 1990; Marsh
et al., 2001). Also, present seismic activity within southern Africa
suggests that the Mwembeshi shear zone is currently tectonically
active (Reeves, 1972, 1978; Reeves and Hutchins, 1975; Fairhead
and Henderson, 1977; Daly et al., 1989), and recent tectonic reactivation along this structure is also indicated by ongoing active
faulting which cuts Neogene dune sediments within the Okavango
Graben in northern Botswana (Modisi, 2000; Modisi et al., 2000;
Kinabo et al., 2007, 2008; Bufford et al., 2012).
There is some geological evidence for Late Mesozoic tectonism
within northwestern Namibia that post dates the Etendeka volcanic episode. An occurrence of an easterly dipping sedimentary unit
containing ning upward cycles of conglomeratic units comprised
entirely of detritus derived from the Etendeka volcanics and preserving sedimentary structures indicating a westerly source region
was documented by Ward and Martin (1987). They suggested that
the unit represents syntectonic proximal deposition against a westerly dipping normal fault and proposed an early Cretaceous depositional age. Along the coastal region there are several NNWSSE
trending, westerly dipping normal faults which have displaced
Etendeka lavas against basement to the east (down to the west
displacement). The age of faulting is clearly post-Etendeka
(post-Early Cretaceous) in both cases but there is no evidence

which provides a denitive lower age. However, seismic reection
data from the offshore Orange basin, further to the south, have
shown that the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary sequence is strongly
deformed on a regional scale (e.g. Dingle et al., 1983; de Vera et al.,
2010).
2.2. Regional geology
The rocks of the Damaran Supergroup, forming the Damara
orogeny and which dominate the present surface geology of northwestern Namibia (Fig. 3), are comprised mainly of metasediments
representing a sedimentary sequence deposited initially within
narrow fault bounded depocenters. These sediments were subsequently overlain by a succession comprising platform carbonates
followed by molasse-type clastic sediments in the north and a
thick (>10 km) ysch-type succession within the Khomas trough
to the south (Tankard et al., 1982; Martin and Eder, 1983). The sedimentary succession experienced regional metamorphism at high
pressures and low temperatures (69 kb (1827 km), <450 C;
<20 C km 1) along the southern margin of the intracontinental
branch. Within the central Damara orogen contact metamorphism
at low pressures and high temperatures (2.5 kb (810 km),
>600 C; 70 C km 1) is also associated with voluminous granite
plutonism (Martin and Eder, 1983; Miller, 1983). The regional
metamorphic grade and the intensity of deformation rapidly
diminishes northwards of the southern margin of the Kamanjab
inlier.
RbSr whole rock isochron ages from some of the granites and
KAr and 40Ar39Ar ages of metamorphic biotite and muscovite
indicates cooling of the basement rocks, following the Pan-African
orogenic phase, through 300350 C between 545480 Ma (e.g.
Haack, 1983; Gray et al., 2006). Radiometric ages of the preDamara basement gneisses and metamorphosed supracrustal
rocks indicate at least two prior periods of tectonism at
2000 Ma (Eburnian/Ubendian) and between 1400 Ma and

23

900 Ma (Kibaran) (Porada, 1979) which are recognised elsewhere
in Africa (Krner, 1977; Hunter, 1981) and in South America where
these two teconic episodes are called the Transamazonian and the
Uruacuano, respectively (Almeida et al., 1976; Cordani et al., 1973).
The nature of the tectonic setting of the intracontinental branch
of the Damara metamorphic belt has been debated for many years
(see reviews by Tankard et al. (1982) and Martin and Eder, (1983)).
The arguments have largely revolved around the degree of plate
divergence between the Zaire cratonic terrain to the north and
the Kalahari cratonic terrain to the south, prior to plate convergence and the associated compressional deformation. Some models have proposed an active plate margin setting involving
closure of a mature ocean basin resulting in continental collision
with southward subduction of the Zaire cratonic plate beneath
the Kalahari cratonic plate (Watters, 1976) while others have suggested similar models with the opposite subduction direction
(Hartnady, 1974, 1979; Barnes and Sawyer, 1980; Kukla and
Stanistreet, 1991). An alternative series of models envisage an
entirely intracontinental rift setting with only minor plate divergence occurring prior to compressional deformation (Martin and
Porada, 1977a, 1977b; Krner, 1977, 1980; Martin, 1976; Porada,
1979; Henry et al., 1990). However, despite their variability all
the tectonic models proposed for the Damara metamorphic belt
agree that the NESW trending intracontinental branch represents
a major tectonic boundary extending well into the sub-continental
lithosphere, and that the initial lithospheric extension and rifting
was followed by compression and shortening. This is supported
by recent seismic tomography models of the African lithosphere
(Fishwick and Bastow, 2011; Priestley et al., 2008).
The major tectonic boundaries within the intracontinental
branch form regional lineaments (e.g. Okahandja, Omaruru and
Us Pass lineaments) which delineate the NESW structural trend
of the belt (Miller, 1979; Downing and Coward, 1981; Henry
et al., 1990; Kukla and Stanistreet, 1991) (Fig. 3). The orientation
of these lineaments reects the regional structural trends that

existed in the pre-Damara metamorphic basement which appear to
have controlled the location of the rift basins into which the early
Damara sediments were deposited (Tankard et al., 1982; Martin
and Eder, 1983; Miller, 1983). This pattern of polyphase or superimposed Precambrian tectonism occurring within narrow zones or
belts which separate more stable cratonic terrains is typical of the
tectonic conguration of continental crust (De Swardt et al., 1965;
Bois et al., 1990; Dallmeyer, 1990; Dallmeyer and Lecorche, 1990)
and is particularly well documented in southern Africa (Tankard
et al., 1982; Hunter, 1981; Krner, 1977). This Precambrian tectonic framework continued to inuence the geological development of northern Namibia throughout the Phanerozoic (e.g.
Gevers, 1936; Clemson et al., 1997; Holzfrster et al., 1999).
The basement is covered in parts by younger sedimentary
sequences. Jurassicearly Cretaceous sediments occur beneath the
cover of the Etendeka ood basalts (Jerram et al., 1999, 2000) and
older Permo-Triassic sedimentary rocks occur in an outlier bounded
to the north by a NESW trending high angle thrust (reverse?) fault
(Holzfrster et al., 1999). Conglomeratic units containing subrounded granitic pebbles and boulders which locally reach thicknesses of 17 m occur towards the base of the 600 m sequence.
These coarse clastic basal layers suggest that the sediments were
derived from a proximal basement source and were probably
deposited within a fault bounded rift basin (Holzfrster et al.,
1999). Elsewhere in Africa the occurrence of Permo-Triassic (Karoo)
sediments is also largely restricted to fault bounded inliers within
the Precambrian metamorphic mobile belts (Fig. 2) (Rosendhal,
1987; Daly et al., 1989; Wopfner, 1988). Syntectonic deposition
within fault bounded depocenters, commonly superimposed on
older basement structures, is typical of many Gondwana PermoTriassic basins (Cox et al., 1965; Green et al., 1980; Basu and
Shrivastava, 1981; Wopfner, 1988; Nichols and Daly, 1989;
Wopfner and Kaaya, 1991; Fielding and Webb, 1996). Sedimentation within the main Karoo basin of South Africa ended during the
Late TriassicEarly Jurassic with a major phase of continental ood
basalt volcanism (Eales et al., 1984) which foreshadowed the fragmentation of Gondwana. In contrast, sedimentation within northwestern Namibia appears to have continued until Early
Cretaceous times (Dingle et al., 1983; Jerram et al., 1999, 2000)
when it too was terminated by a major episode of ood basalt volcanism and accompanying sub-volcanic alkaline intrusives (Marsh,
1973; Moore, 1976; Erlank et al., 1984; Jerram et al., 1999), associated with the initial rifting leading to the opening of the South
Atlantic. These volcanic rocks form the Etendeka volcanic province
in Namibia (e.g. Erlank et al., 1984; Milner et al., 1995) and the
Paran ood basalt province in southeastern Brazil (e.g. Peate
et al., 1990, 1997).
Radiometric ages for the Etendeka volcanics range from
133 Ma to 127 Ma (e.g. Trumbull et al., 2007). The oldest magnetic seaoor spreading anomaly recognised off the Namibian
coast is anomaly M4 (127 Ma) (Austin and Uchupi, 1982) while
just north of the Falkland Agulhas Fracture Zone (FAFZ) the oldest
magnetic anomaly identied is M11 (133 Ma) (Martin, 1987;
Cande et al., 1988) with successively younger anomalies abutting
the continent ocean boundary in a northerly direction. The subaerial, post-Etendeka geology of northern Namibia is limited to a
relatively thin (few hundred metres) and poorly dated Cenozoic
sedimentary succession (Ward, 1987, 1988; Ward and Martin,
1987) and minor occurrences of alkaline volcanics (Auas Mountains, Windhoek) (Tankard et al., 1982; Marsh, 2010). Despite their
limited extent these Cenozoic rocks provide information of considerable importance for understanding the post-Gondwana geological development of the region. The basal unit of the succession is
the Tsondab Sandstone Formation believed to be of Early to Middle
Tertiary in age (Ward, 1988) and which unconformably overlies an
extensive erosion surface (Namib Unconformity Surface) cut into

the predominantly Late Precambrian basement rocks (Ollier,
1977, 1978; Ward, 1987,1988). The Tsondab Sandstone Formation
is comprised predominantly of reddish brown, quartz arenite and
was deposited largely as desert dunes and sand sheets under arid
conditions (Ward, 1987; 1988). The Karpenkliff Conglomerate Formation of probable Early Miocene age (Ward, 1987) unconformably overlies the Tsondab sandstone formation, and was
deposited as large alluvial fans which wedge out westwards away
from the foot of a major erosional escarpment cut into the Late Precambrian basement rocks. The alluvial nature of the Karpenkliff
Conglomerate Formation and the assemblage of large (up to
95 cm), rounded to well rounded clasts of resistant rock types
derived from the Precambrian basement implies substantial denudation of the escarpment region (Ward, 1987) at the time of deposition. The uvial character and mode of deposition of this
rudaceous deposit was interpreted by Ward (1987) as representing
the earliest record of a well developed westerly directed drainage
system and therefore a change from arid to semi-arid conditions.
With the establishment in the Late Miocene of the cold, upwelling
system of the Benguela Current there was a return to arid conditions which developed into the current Namib Desert regime
(Siesser, 1978, 1980) promoting the accumulation of the Sossus
Sand Formation which now forms the main Namib Sand Sea south
of the Kuiseb river (Ward, 1987). Deep incision of the westerly
directed Kuiseb drainage system since the Pliocene was interpreted by Ward (1987) as evidence for Late Tertiary epeirogenic
uplift.
The regional topography of northern Namibia is dominated to the
south by a prominent erosional escarpment cut into the Late Precambrian metamorphic or igneous rocks which runs sub-parallel
to and between 100 km and 80 km from the present coastline
(Ollier, 1977, 1978; Ward, 1987). At about 23 S the escarpment is
cut by the Swakop river valley which has a northeasterly trend and
runs roughly parallel to the Okahandja lineament and forms the
northern boundary of the elevated region (> 1400 m) known as
the Khomas Hochland (Highland) which continues inland to become
the Windhoek highlands. North of the Swakop river valley the
escarpment diminishes to a graded surface which rises steadily eastwards from sea level at the coast to an elevated plateau (at
1400  100 m) approximately 200300 km inland. Numerous inselbergs occur seaward of the escarpment region and many of the Early
Cretaceous alkaline intrusive rocks form isolated but spectacular
mountains such as the Brandberg (2585 m), Erongo and Spitzkoppe.
There is clearly abundant geological and geophysical evidence
for distinct, superimposed episodes of transcontinental intraplate
tectonism in Africa. The Precambrian Ubendian (2000 Ma) and
Kibaran (1100 Ma) episodes, the Pan-African episode during the
earliest Phanerozoic (500 Ma) and the Karoo episode during the
Permo-Triassic (230 Ma) and the Late Mesozoic episodes associated with the fragmentation of Gondwana and the development
of the present ocean basins. This suggests that broadly coeval
and spatially superimposed episodes of transcontinental tectonism
are an integral part of continental dynamics, reecting a fundamental and long-lived lithospheric structural conguration inherited from the earliest phases of continental assembly.
Considering the past tectonic history of the Damara metamorphic
belt it seems reasonable to expect the occurrence of discreet episodes of post-Gondwana tectonism, possibly coeval with episodes
elsewhere in Africa, within northwestern Namibia.

3. Apatite ssion track analysis results
The 38 rock samples analysed were collected from outcropping
Damaran granites or metasediments, or from the pre-Damaran
metamorphic basement rocks. The samples were collected over a

R. Brown et al. / Journal of African Earth Sciences 100 (2014) 2041

range of elevations from sea level up to 2260 m. Sample locations
are indicated on the simplied geological map shown in Fig. 3.
Details of the lithology of each sample are provided in Appendix
1. The sampling rationale was to collect a regional suite of Late Precambrian (pre-Karoo) samples over the maximum possible range
of topographic elevations while being mindful of the regional
structural and tectonic boundaries (such as the Omaruru and Okahandja lineaments). Within the central zone of the Damara belt a
roughly NESW transect was sampled between Okahandja
(1450 m) and Swakopmund (sea level) over a horizontal distance
of 300 km. To the south of the Okahandja lineament, within the
southern marginal zone, a 1500 m vertical topographic prole
was sampled over a horizontal distance of 150 km between the
Gaub river gorge (700 m) and Gamsberg (2260 m).
Apatite ssion track ages and conned track length measurement results are reported for all samples in Table 1. Ages were
measured by the external detector method (EDM) (Gleadow,
1981) using the zeta calibration technique (Hurford and Green,
1983; Green, 1985).
The apatite ssion track ages measured for this study range
from 59  3 Ma to 449  20 Ma, which closely matches the range
determined by Haack (1976, 1983), Raab (2001) and Raab et al.
(2002, 2005). Mean conned track length measurements range
from 14.61  0.20 lm to 10.83  0.66 lm with the younger samples generally having the longer mean track lengths. There is a distinct lack of apatite ssion track ages older than 150 Ma at
elevations below 1000 m but ages younger than this occur below
as well as above this elevation (Fig. 4). When all the apatite ssion
track ages are plotted against their distance north and south of, and
measured perpendicular to, the Okahandja lineament a pattern
remarkably similar to the age versus elevation plot is obtained
(with distance substituting for elevation) (Fig. 4).
This relationship indicates a positive correlation between elevation and distance north and south of the Okahandja lineament,
with generally lower elevations occurring to the north and higher
elevations to the south (Fig. 4). This topographic relationship is
clearly related to the development of the Swakop river valley
which closely follows the NESW trend of the Okahandja lineament. This relationship suggests that the apatite ssion track ages
are correlated primarily with elevation, which is reecting the possible inuence of the Okahandja lineament on the location of the
Swakop river valley. Apatite ssion track ages also generally
decrease towards the coast, reecting the regional topography
which is characterised by an elevated interior plateau separated
from the coastal region by an escarpment south of the Swakop
river but descending more gradually to sea level north of the Swakop river valley. Note that the ages for samples 8732-78 and 873279, of 437  23 Ma and 435  34 Ma respectively, are not shown in
Fig. 4.

4. Discussion and interpretation of ssion track results
Radiometric ages (summarised above) representative of the
rocks sampled for apatite ssion track analysis indicate that the
present land surface exposes rocks that cooled to below 300 C
(approximate closure temperature for KAr and 40Ar39Ar biotite
ages) by 480 Ma (Haack, 1976, 1983; Gray et al., 2006). In the
northern coastal region there are several outliers of Permian glacial
sediments preserved within pre-glacial valleys, cut by a westerly
directed drainage system into the Late Precambrian basement
rocks (Martin, 1953, 1976; Dingle et al., 1983; Visser, 1987). Isolated patches of glacial sediments also occur further south within
the central Damara metamorphic belt. These glacial deposits suggest that the present land surface represents an exhumed prePermian erosion surface at some localities, or at least that the pres-

ent level of denudation has cut a new erosion surface at a level
close to the Permian glacial surface. This would imply that many
of the presently outcropping basement rocks were at, or close to,
the surface before or at least by the end of the Permian glaciation.
Some of the samples collected for apatite ssion track analysis are
therefore likely to have initially cooled to below 110  10 C at
some time between 500 Ma and 260 Ma. The older apatite ssion track ages of 450 Ma conrms that some of the presently
outcropping basement rocks did cool to below 110  10 C soon
after the peak of Damaran orogenic activity at 500 Ma and have
since remained below this temperature.
Considering the regional structural features of the Damara
metamorphic belt and the evidence for subsequent reactivation
of many of them, it seems useful to examine separately the detail
of AFTA results from within recognised structural domains. The
eleven samples from the transect between Okahandja and Swakopmund (RM 1423 and 8732-578732-65) are bounded by the Okahandja lineament to the south and the Omaruru lineament to the
north (Fig. 3) and are therefore considered as representative of that
structural domain. The eight samples (RB 2543 and 8832-107
8832-119) making up the vertical topographic prole between
the Gaub river gorge and the summit of Gamsberg are also considered to be representative of a single structural domain. The AFTA
results for these two sample groups will be discussed in some
detail and the conclusions drawn from this discussion will then
be used as basis for interpreting the results obtained for the
remaining samples.
4.1. OkahandjaSwakopmund transect
The apatite ssion track ages from the Okahandja-Swakopmund
transect decrease towards the coast from 449  20 Ma 40 km
west of Okahandja (RM1423) to 69  6 Ma (8732-62B) 100 km
east of Swakopmund. The three samples nearest the coast (873263, -64 and -65) gave slightly higher apatite ssion track ages of
77  8 Ma. Mean conned track lengths for the younger samples
(<80 Ma) range from 13.75  0.18 lm to 14.61  0.2 lm with an
average value of 14.2 lm. The samples with apatite ssion track
ages older than 80 Ma have shorter mean conned track lengths
which range from 14.18 0.24 lm to 11.16  0.70 lm. When the
apatite ssion track age and mean conned track length for each
sample is plotted against sample elevation (Fig. 5) a pronounced
inection is apparent at 1200 m on both the apatite age and
the mean conned track length proles. The apatite ssion track
ages remain relatively constant 75  5 Ma from sea level up to
1200 m and become rapidly older at higher elevations while
the mean conned track length also remains relatively constant
at 14.2 lm up to the same threshold elevation but decreases rapidly above this elevation.
Single grain ages and conned track length distributions for a
representative suite of samples from the OkahandjaSwakopmund
transect are illustrated in Fig. 6. The composite radial plot
(Galbraith, 1988, 1990) of the single grain ages (Fig. 6a), indicates
a continuous array of ages from 500 Ma through to 70 Ma. The
oldest sample, (RM1423) with a pooled age of 449  40 Ma, and the
youngest sample (8732-60A), with a pooled age of 71  5 Ma, have
no single grain ages signicantly older or younger than their
weighted mean grain ages (pooled ages). However, the two samples with intermediate apatite ssion track ages (8732-57 and
8732-58) show a signicant spread in single grain age but with
all the apatite grains giving ages <500 Ma and >70 Ma. This difference in the distribution of single grain ages is clearly reected
by the c2 statistic (Galbraith, 1981) for each sample which provides
a measure of the dispersion or spread of single grain ages. The c2
probabilities for both the oldest (RM1423; P(v2) = 69%) and youngest (8732-60A; P(v2) = 50%) samples indicates that the measured

spread of single grain ages is consistent with them being samples
derived from single age populations. However, due to the generally
high precision of the single grain ages (see samples 8732-62 and
8732-63) for these young samples the v2 probabilities are often
low indicating that the small variation in single grain age may be

signicant. The two intermediate age samples, however, have v2
probabilities which indicate that the spread in single grain ages
is not consistent with them being derived from single age populations (8732-57; P(v2)  1% and 8732-58; P(v2) = 2%). This pattern
in the spread of single grain ages suggests that the suite of samples

Fig. 4. Comparison between apatite ssion track ages from this study (black circles,
l) and those from Haack (1976, 1983) (open circles). In the two upper panels apatite
ssion track age is plotted against sample elevation and sample distance south
(positive) or north (negative) of the Okahandja lineament (see Fig. 3). In the lower
panel sample elevation is plotted against sample distance south (positive) or north
(negative) of the Okahandja lineament. The similarity between the two distributions of apatite age, shown in the upper two panels, implies that there is a positive
correlation between elevation and distance south (positive) of north the Okahandja
lineament. This is relationship is conrmed by the positive correlation between
sample elevation and distance south or north of the Okahandja Lineament shown in
the lower panel. Apatite ssion track age is therefore primarily correlated with
elevation, which itself is correlated with distance from the Okahandja lineament.
This pattern largely results from the coincidence between the Swakop River valley
and the Okahandja lineament, and therefore does not necessarily imply any
structural displacement across the lineament.

have experienced a range of post-Damara maximum palaeotemperatures prior to an episode of cooling at approximately 70 Ma,
with the oldest sample having experienced only a moderate to
low degree of thermal annealing since initially cooling to somewhat less than 70 C at or before 500 Ma and with the youngest
sample having experienced temperatures in excess of 110  10 C
prior to 70 Ma.
The conned track length distributions (Fig. 6a) for these samples provide additional support for the proposed interpretation of
the apatite ssion track ages. The youngest samples (8732-60A
and 8732-61) both have narrow, unimodal conned track length
distributions with mean track lengths of 14 lm and standard
deviations slightly greater than 1 lm. The older samples all have
much broader track length distributions and shorter mean track
lengths (11.2012.16 lm), as a consequence of having a signicant
number of short tracks (<10 lm) present in addition to a longer
component of tracks similar to that preserved by the youngest
samples. In the oldest sample (RM1423) the shorter tracks
represent the major component of the distribution with a modal

Fig. 5. Apatite ssion track age (lled squares) and mean conned track length
(lled circles) plotted against sample elevation for the samples from the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect (upper panel) and the GamsbergGaub River prole
(lower panel). The anticipated break-in-slope at an age of c. 8070 Ma and elevation
of c. 500 m is shown by the black dashed line and question mark symbol below c.
500 m on the Gamsberg-Gaub River age-elevation trajectory. This is based on
extrapolation of the age-elevation relationship observed for the Okahandja
Swakopmund transect above. The maximum palaeotemperatures indicated by the
scales on the right were estimated from the conned track length distributions and
the degree of age reduction, assuming an initial age of 500 Ma. These palaeotemperatures are not well constrained but they do suggest that relatively normal
palaeogeothermal gradients existed within the shallow crust prior to the initiation
of denudation. The restored positions of samples that are believed to have been
displaced by faults are shown on both diagrams by the open symbols (see text for
discussion).

length between 11 lm and 12 lm, and the longer component
of tracks forms a much smaller peak with a modal length of
14 lm. As the apatite ssion track age decreases so too does
the modal length of the shorter component of ssion tracks, but
the modal length of the longer component remains at 14 lm
and it becomes the dominant modal length. Once the age has been
reduced to the minimum age of 70 Ma only the longer component of tracks remains.
This relationship between apatite ssion track age and the
detailed shape of the conned track length distributions is characteristic of a suite of samples that records various degrees of thermal annealing (thermal resetting of the apatite ssion track age)
which occurred prior to a common episode of cooling (e.g.
Gallagher et al., 1998). The pronounced inection in the apatite ssion track age and mean conned track length proles (Fig. 5)
marks the transition from partially annealed samples (above the
inection) to completely annealed samples (below the inection).
This transition therefore represents the position of the
110  10 C palaeoisotherm (the maximum temperature for ssion
track retention in apatite) prior to cooling, implying that samples
above this transition have experienced palaeotemperatures less
than 110 C and those below the transition temperatures greater
than 110 C. The age at which this inection occurs will thus closely approximate the time at which cooling began.

4.2. GamsbergGaub river prole
The eight apatite ssion track ages from the GamsbergGaub
river prole range from 317  44 Ma (8832-111) to 90  6 Ma
(8832-107). When apatite ssion track age is plotted against sample elevation two essentially linear and parallel trends are apparent (Fig. 5), with the three highest samples forming one prole
and the ve lower samples forming the other. In both proles
the apatite ssion track age is strongly correlated with elevation
with a gradient of 3 m Ma 1. Apart for the oldest and the youngest samples (8832-111 and 8832-107) the mean conned track
lengths are all similar and range from 11.92  0.38 lm to
12.10  0.42 lm. The mean lengths for both the oldest and the
youngest
sample
are
longer,
13.48  0.86 lm
and
14.39  0.58 lm, respectively, but are likely to be biased towards
longer lengths seeing that only a small number (<20) of tracks
were measured for these samples.
Single grain ages and conned track length distributions for
selected samples are illustrated in Fig. 6b. As for the Okahandja
Swakopmund transect samples the single grain ages form a continuous array between 500 Ma and 70 Ma. However, all the samples (except 8832-119) from the GamsbergGaub river prole
have v2 probabilities that indicate that the spread in single grain
ages is consistent with each sample representing a single age population (P(v2) P 5%). This may be due, in part at least, to the generally low precision of the single grain age estimates for these
samples. This distribution of single grain ages suggests that these
eight samples may also be reecting a range of post-Damaran maximum palaeotemperatures prior to cooling during the Late
Cretaceous.
This interpretation is supported by the conned track length
measurements for these samples. Despite having similar mean
conned track lengths, the conned track length distributions for
the four intermediate age samples shown in Fig. 6b have some
important differences. Sample PH-2 has a distinctly unimodal but
moderately wide (standard deviation of 1.78 lm) distribution of

conned track lengths with a mean length of 11.92  0.38 lm
and an apatite ssion track age of 288  24 Ma. Sample 8832-114
on the other hand has a slightly broader (standard deviation of
2.09 lm) conned track length distribution which appears to be
bimodal and has a younger age of 252  32 Ma. The conned track
length distributions for samples 8832-110 and 8832-116, which
have slightly younger ages of 214  26 Ma and 198  26 Ma respectively, are also broad (standard deviations of 2.48 lm and 2.07 lm)
and do not appear to be unimodal. The youngest sample (8832107) which has an age of 90  12 Ma has an apparently unimodal
and relatively narrow (standard deviation of 1.03 lm) conned
track length distribution with a mean length of 14.39  0.58 lm.
However, seeing that only 13 conned tracks were measured for
this sample (8832-107) the measurement is not very reliable. In
spite of the uncertainty in the conned track length measurements
the overall relationship between apatite ssion track age and the
shape of the track length distributions is similar to that shown
by the samples from the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect.
The similarity in the apatite age-elevation gradient for both the
upper and lower proles (Fig. 5), in conjunction with the observation that all eight samples form an apparently coherent series
reecting various degrees of thermal annealing, suggests that the
two proles may simply represent displaced segments of the same
prole. This would imply that the upper three samples are from a
crustal block that has been displaced upwards, relative to the other
samples, by approximately 700 m. The three highest samples
(8832-119, 8832-116, 8832-114) were all collected from the
Gamsberg two-mica granite and the other samples (except PH-2)
were collected from Damaran micaceous schists. The Gamsberg
granite is bounded to the north and south by thrust faults which
form part of the southern boundary to the Damara metamorphic
belt. It seems possible therefore that these faults have been reactivated in post-Damara times and that the Gamsberg is part of a
crustal block that has been displaced upwards relative to the surrounding region. It is interesting to note that the summit of Gamsberg, which is the second highest peak (2326 m) in Namibia, is

R. Brown et al. / Journal of African Earth Sciences 100 (2014) 2041

capped by a thin (10 m) layer of quartz cemented sandstone
believed to be of late Karoo age (Triassic). This small outlier is
the only occurrence of Karoo age sediments in this region (Dingle
et al., 1983).
4.3. EtendekaBrandberg region
The eight samples (8732-71 to 8732-77 and 8732-80) bounded
to the south by the Omaruru lineament and to the north by the
northern boundary of the Damara metamorphic belt form a distinct group with uniformly similar apatite ssion track ages and
conned track length distributions. The apatite ssion track ages
range from 81  12 Ma to 110  16 Ma with mean conned track
lengths between 12.65  0.34 lm and 13.49  0.32 lm. The conned track length distributions are all unimodal with a modal
length between 13 and 14 lm and several samples (8732-74,
8732-75 and 8732-77) have subtle but distinct tails of highly
annealed tracks (<10 lm) which is reected by the slightly higher
standard deviations for these samples of between 1.59 lm and
2.06 lm. The distribution of single grain ages for the eight samples
is variable with four of the samples having v2 probabilities <5% and
four >5% with the older samples generally having the higher values. Most of the single grain ages (for all eight samples) range from
an older limit of 140 Ma to a lower limit of about 70 Ma but the
younger samples do have a few grains which are signicantly
younger than 70 Ma.
The distinctly unimodal and relatively narrow character of the
conned track length distributions for samples with apatite ssion
track ages older than 70 Ma and the paucity of highly annealed
tracks (<10 lm) within these distributions is markedly different
from both the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect and the Gamsberg prole samples. This distinctive form of the conned track
length distributions and the lack of any single grain ages much
older than 140 Ma suggests that all these samples were exposed
to palaeotemperatures in excess of 110  10 C (and thus were
completely annealed) during the earliest Cretaceous. The lower
limit to the range of single grain ages of 70 Ma (noting that there
are also a few younger grains) suggests that, like the previous two
sample suites, many of these samples remained at elevated temperatures (100  10 C) until approximately 70 Ma. Also, the generally broad spread of single grain ages and the reduced modal
track lengths of 13 lm for most of these samples indicate that
cooling from these elevated temperatures was probably
protracted.
4.4. A regional framework for interpretation of the ssion track results
A useful regional summary of the AFTA results for all samples
north of and including the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect is
provided by plotting apatite ssion track age against the mean conned track length for each sample (Fig. 7). Selected conned track
length distributions are also shown in Fig. 7 as are histograms of
available radiometric ages for the Damaran metasediments and
granites (Martin and Eder, 1983) and for the Etendeka volcanics
and sub-volcanic intrusions (Marsh, 1973; Fitch and Miller, 1984;
Trumbull et al., 2007). The AFTA parameters predicted by the thermal modelling results which are presented and discussed in the
next section are also indicated on the diagrams of Fig. 7 (the open
symbols).
The regional relationship between apatite ssion track age and
mean conned track length is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 7 which
shows the youngest and oldest samples having the longer, and the
intermediate age samples having the shorter, mean conned track
lengths. This general pattern, sometimes referred to as a boomerang trend, is typical of a suite of samples representing various
degrees of partial annealing with the apparent apatite ssion track

ages for the various samples ranging between a common older initial age, and a younger terminal age which closely approximates
the time that cooling from the maximum palaeotemperatures
began. The oldest apatite ssion track ages measured of 450 Ma
(RM 1423, 8732-78 and 8732-79) are younger but close to the peak
of Damaran metamorphism and granite intrusion which is illustrated by the histogram of radiometric ages shown in Fig. 7a. However, the shortened mean track lengths (11.40  0.4 lm to
12.10  0.42 lm) and the distinct positive skewness of the distribution of track lengths for these samples indicates that they cooled
to below 110  10 C some time before 450 Ma. The presence of
single grain ages of around 500 Ma in these older samples also
points towards initial cooling being somewhat earlier than
450 Ma and thus closely following the peak of Damaran metamorphism and granite plutonism at 500 Ma. The youngest samples with the longest mean track lengths suggest that a distinct
episode of cooling began at 70 Ma, which post-dates the Etendeka magmatism by at least 40 Ma. The regional AFTA data set
thus appears to represent a boomerang-type trend with an apparent initial apatite ssion track age of close of 500 Ma and a younger terminal age of 70 Ma.
Examining the cluster of AFTA data forming the younger end of
the apparent regional boomerang trend at a more appropriate scale
(Fig. 7b) reveals a more complicated relationship between apatite
ssion track age and mean conned track length. The samples from
the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect appear to conform to the
regional boomerang trend in that the mean track length decreases
progressively as the apatite ssion track age increases from the terminal age of 70 Ma towards the apparent initial age of 500 Ma.
However, the samples from the EtendekaBrandberg region clearly
deviate from the apparent regional trend forming an array in which
the mean conned track length actually increases as the apatite ssion track age increases. The oldest apatite ssion track age
obtained from the basement samples from the EtendekaBrandberg region is remarkably similar to the younger limit of Etendeka
magmatism at close to 120 Ma and coincides with the older apatite
ssion track ages obtained for the Brandberg alkaline ring complex
(samples MD 08 and MD 12). It is tempting, therefore, to suggest
that this distinct secondary array forms a younger boomerang
trend with an apparent initial age of about 110120 Ma but with
the same terminal age (70 Ma) as the regional trend. This secondary array may be thought of as representing a younger boomerang trend which was initiated by thermal overprinting of the
basement rocks during the Etendeka magmatic episode, and was
terminated by the same cooling episode recorded by the regional
or older boomerang trend at 70 Ma.
In reality, the cluster of AFTA data shown in Fig. 7b occupies a
roughly wedge shaped region bounded at the top by an idealised
younger boomerang trend and at the bottom by the idealised
older regional boomerang trend. This distribution of the AFTA
data is to be expected if an older boomerang trend is only partially reset by a younger episode of thermal annealing. This scenario is illustrated schematically in Fig. 8. Imagine a sequence of
samples which cooled instantaneously from temperatures greater
than 110  10 C to a range of temperatures between
110  10 C and 20 C at 500 Ma. If these samples subsequently
remained at these temperatures until 70 Ma at which time they
all began to cool until they were all at 20 C by the present, then
the apatite ssion track ages and mean track lengths of these samples could be expected to form an idealistic boomerang trend such
as the Old Boomerang shown in Fig. 8a.
Consider a hypothetical sample (solid black dots in Fig. 8a)
shown as a member of this idealistic Old Boomerang trend. If this
sample was subjected to elevated temperatures at 120 Ma then
all the ssion tracks that had accumulated over the 380 million
years since the sample rst cooled below 110  10 C (that is

transect samples (lled symbols) and the modelled AFTA results (open symbols). All the data are shown in a and a sub-set of the data (ages < 200 Ma) is shown at an expanded
scale in b. The modelled AFTA parameters were generated by the thermal models discussed in the text and illustrated in Fig. 9 in conjunction with the annealing model of
Laslett et al. (1987). The open squares represent results from the Overprint model (samples affected by the Etendeka magmatism), the open circles represent results from the
Inland model and the open stars results from the Coastal model. Measured conned track length distributions for selected samples are also shown as shaded histograms, and
are labelled accordingly. Modelled conned track length distributions (dashed black lines) are shown superimposed on the measured length distributions. The histograms
shown along the base of the boomerang plots were constructed using appropriate radiometric ages for the Damara metamorphic and granitic rocks (Martin and Eder, 1983),
and for the Etendeka volcanic rocks (Marsh, 1973; Fitch and Miller, 1984; Trumbull et al., 2007).

500 Ma) would be further annealed and thus become shorter. If
the additional thermal annealing was sufcient to severely shorten
the pre-existing ssion tracks, such that their mean length was
reduced to less than 1112 lm, they would represent a signicantly smaller proportion of the nal track length distribution. This
would occur because of the highly biased nature of the track length
measurements which are strongly biased towards track lengths
greater than 11 lm (Laslett et al., 1982). The long component
of tracks which accumulated after cooling began at 70 Ma would
thus represent a greater proportion of the nal distribution of conned track lengths and the mean length would be longer. The
apparent ssion track age, however, would be reduced because
the earlier formed tracks (those that formed prior to thermal
annealing) would contribute less to the nal ssion track age.
The resultant reduction in apparent ssion track age and
increase in mean conned track length for our hypothetical sample

causes it to shift its position on the boomerang plot towards longer
mean lengths and younger ages (Fig. 8a). The degree of thermal
annealing at 120 Ma would determine the magnitude of this
shift. If the increased temperature was sufcient to completely
erase all the pre-existing ssion tracks then the sample would
move onto the Young Boomerang with its position on this new
boomerang trend being a function of the degree of thermal annealing experienced between 120 Ma and the initiation of the terminal cooling episode at 70 Ma. The distribution of the AFTA data
shown in Fig. 8b therefore suggests that the EtendekaBrandberg
samples may have been exposed to elevated temperatures during
the Etendeka magmatic episode which were sufcient to cause
severe, but generally not complete, thermal annealing of any preexisting ssion tracks.
Several qualitative, but nevertheless important, constraints can
now be placed on the likely post-Damara thermal history of the

ages but the same terminal age (70 Ma in this case). The idealised young boomerang trend corresponds to the modelled AFTA results from the Overprint model and the old
boomerang corresponds to the results from the Inland model (the thermal models are discussed in the text). The trajectories of samples that are only partially annealed by the
thermal event at 120 Ma (Etendeka magmatism?) are illustrated by the dashed arrows. This shift, towards lower apparent apatite ages and longer mean conned track
lengths, results from a reduction in the proportion of shortened tracks which contribute to both the age and mean length measurements. (b) Diagrammatic summary of the

presently outcropping basement rocks of northern Namibia. The
maximum palaeotemperatures experienced by most of these rocks
since initial post-Damara cooling must have been less than
110  10 C except for those samples with apatite ssion track ages
of 70 Ma or younger. However, some samples may have been
exposed to temperatures in excess of 110  10 C during the Etendeka magmatic episode. The youngest ages (70 Ma) with the
longest mean track lengths (>14 lm) indicate that a distinct and
possibly regional episode of cooling was initiated at around
70 Ma ago. The strong correlation between apatite ssion track
age and mean conned track length with elevation, indicated by
the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect and Gamsberg prole samples (Fig. 5), suggests that the present sample elevations reect
the relative crustal depths of the samples, at least on a local scale,
prior to the initiation of cooling. The present erosion surface therefore exposes rocks that were at signicantly elevated temperatures
at least until 70 Ma ago which implies that several kilometres of

denudation must have occurred on a regional scale during the Late
MesozoicEarly Tertiary, even allowing for elevated palaeogeothermal gradients of the order of 60 C km 1. This clearly has some
important implications for the burial history of the post-glacial
Permian erosion surface and the subsequent geomorphic history
of northern Namibia.
5. Quantifying the thermal history interpretation
In order to place more quantitative constraints on the proposed
post-Damara thermal history a simple 1D numerical thermal
model that accounts for magmatic heating and erosion simultaneously (Brown et al., 1994b) was used to explore a range of viable
thermal history interpretations. The aim of the thermal modelling
was to quantify and explicitly link the thermal history interpretation to a physical process or combination of processes, such as
magmatic under plating and intrusion, crustal extension and

32

thinning and erosion. This strategy is different to the more conventional data driven inversion approach whereby constraints on viable thermal histories are chosen by automatically comparing the
goodness of t between predicted AFTA parameters and the observations alone, without any reference to, or constraint from, the
physical processes involved (e.g. Gallagher, 2012). Our aim was
to derive the simplest physically based thermal history that was
consistent with the quantitative and the qualitative characteristics
of the AFTA results, while remaining compatible with other relevant geological and geophysical data. Rather than attempting to
reproduce the AFTA results for each sample separately the modelling approach adopted attempted to derive a burial/thermal model
that could best reproduce all the observed AFTA results over a discreet crustal section (vertical prole) or region. Our approach follows the rationale outlined by Prenzel et al. (2013) whereby both
the geological as well as the thermochronological observations
and constraints are used to interpret the AFTA data in terms of
the style, chronology and timing of cooling of the crust.
It is unreasonable to expect a simple one dimensional thermal
model to be able to satisfy all of the quantitative characteristics
of what is essentially a three dimensional data set. In particular,
the regional nature of the AFTA data implies they must represent,
at least to some extent, lateral variations in the thermal history of
the region. However, the thermal effects of regional denudation
and magmatic underplating (e.g. Furlong and Fountain, 1986),
the two important processes that are incorporated in the thermal
models, are themselves regional in nature. If the thermal history
of the shallow crust in any particular region is largely controlled
by the interaction of these two regional thermal processes then
an appropriate one dimensional thermal model should be capable
of producing an adequate approximation of the near surface
(<5 km) temperature distribution within the crust.
Five different thermal models were derived which were
intended to represent the likely thermal histories for ve separate
but possibly overlapping regions. The models represent a coastal
region (area west of the escarpment) an inland region and the
northern (Kamanjab region) and southern (Gamsberg prole) margins of the Damara metamorphic belt. The fth model represents
samples that may have been affected by near-surface heating associated with the Etendeka magmatic episode.
5.1. Geological constraints on the post-Damara thermal history
Quantifying the burial history of the present land surface is hindered by the limited amount of information regarding the likely
thickness of the denuded Karoo and Etendeka cover sequences.
The maximum preserved thickness of 600 m of Karoo age sediments occurs within the Etjo inlier while the thickest preserved
section of Etendeka volcanics reaches 800 m at Tafelberg
(Marsh et al., 2001). Isolated outcrops of Etendeka(?) lavas occur
at elevations of 2000 m, within what appears to be caldera structures, within the Brandberg and Erongo alkaline ring complexes,
and the isolated sandstone outcrops, believed to be of Karoo age,
which form the summits of Gamsberg and Klein Gamsberg occur
at elevations in excess of 2000 m. These outcrops may represent
the remnants of a much thicker, and more extensive cover
sequence. On the other hand the sub-volcanic intrusives may have
been intruded into localised volcanic piles and the Gamsberg block
may have been structurally displaced, in which case there is no
need to infer a substantially thicker cover sequence. However,
the thickness of the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary sequence preserved offshore (Rust and Summereld, 1990; Rouby et al., 2009;
Guillocheau et al., 2012) and the Late Mesozoic palaeotemperatures indicated by the AFTA data mitigate in favour of a more
extensive cover sequence, reaching thicknesses of at least several
kilometres in places.

In addition to the problems concerning the limited stratigraphic
information there is also the problem of choosing, or preferably
estimating, an appropriate Late Mesozoic palaeogeothermal gradient. Thermobarometry data from the Damaran metamorphic rocks
(Martin and Eder, 1983; Miller, 1983) indicate peak metamorphic
palaeogeothermal gradients of 6070 C km 1 for the central
region, and 20 C km 1 for the southern marginal zone (Gamsberg region) of the Damara metamorphic belt. Measurements of
radioactive heat production within the Damara granites, which
occur largely within the central zone of the belt, are also anomalously high (48  10 6 W m 3) (Haack, 1983). These data
prompted Haack (1983) to propose that the Damara granites provided a long-lived radioactive heat source which sustained the lateral variation in peak metamorphic palaeogeothermal gradient
through to the present. He suggested that it was this lateral variation in palaeogeothermal gradient that gave rise to the apparent
gradient in apatite ssion track age across the Okahandja lineament. However, present day heat ow measurements (Ballard
et al., 1987) from northern Namibia document a relatively constant
geothermal gradient of 1824 C km 1 across much of the region,
despite the anomalous heat production values for the Damaran
granites, which mitigates against the proposal for a long-lived lateral variation in geothermal gradient. The maximum palaeotemeratures estimated from the AFTA data (Fig. 5) also suggest that
relatively normal thermal gradients (2035 C km 1) existed prior
to the initiation of Late Mesozoic denudation.
On the other hand, there is some evidence that substantial
amounts of basaltic magma were added to the base, or intruded
into, the lower crust during the early stages of continental rifting
(e.g. White and McKenzie, 1989; Bauer et al., 2000; Fernandez
et al., 2010). The addition of large volumes of basaltic magma to
the crust would produce a transient increase in the geothermal
gradient. The Etendeka volcanic sequence contains a large proportion (75%) of rhyolitic lavas interbedded with the basaltic lavas
(Erlank et al., 1984; Marsh et al., 2001). The geochemistry of the
rhyolitic lavas suggests that they were derived from partial melting
of Damaran crustal rocks, where as the source of basaltic lavas has
been interpreted as being heterogeneously enriched continental
lithosphere (Erlank et al., 1984). The source of heat required to produce the observed volume of rhyolitic lavas may well have been
the large volumes of basaltic magma (represented by the combined
Paran and Etendeka provinces) generated by lithospheric thinning
occurring over the Tristan da Cunha mantle plume, and which
were underplated onto or intruded into the lower crust.
Some evidence for basaltic underplating is provided by regional
seismic refraction proles within the Damara mobile belt (Baier
et al., 1983; Bauer et al., 2000). There does not appear to be a well
dened crustmantle seismic transition (Moho) but rather a diffuse boundary occurring over 1015 km. The velocity prole
shows this zone, between approximately 30 km and 45 km depth,
to have maximum P wave velocities of between 7.0 and 8.0 km s 1.
This type of crustal P wave velocity structure has been interpreted
in several other regions as being indicative of magmatic thickening
of the crust by underplating of basaltic magmas onto and intrusion
into the lower crust (White et al., 1987a,b; White and McKenzie,
1989; Durrheim and Mooney, 1991, 1994; Nguuri et al., 2001).
Additional evidence which supports the basaltic underplating
hypothesis comes from petrogenetic arguments which suggest that
the Karoo lavas (Central Karoo and Etendeka provinces) evolved to
their present compositions by some form of low pressure fractional
crystallization process (Marsh and Eales, 1984; Erlank et al., 1984).
Following White and McKenzies (1989) suggestion, that permanent regional surface uplift of northwestern Namibia could have
been generated by basaltic underplating following rifting over
the Tristan da Cunha mantle plume, Cox (1989) proposed that
the present day drainage patterns within northern Namibia form

R. Brown et al. / Journal of African Earth Sciences 100 (2014) 2041

a roughly radial pattern which he suggested might be reecting the
regional domal uplift caused by the magmatic underplating. However, Gilchrist and Summereld (1990) argue that drainage patterns are consequent upon the current topography, which reects
many inuences that post-date the proposed domal uplift. Analysis
of the offshore sedimentary record for the Namibian and South
African sectors of the margin also suggest a more complex topographic evolution including post-rift phase/s of uplift and/or major
climate change (e.g. Guillocheau et al., 2012).
5.2. The thermal modelling results
The schematic burial histories, for the pre-Karoo unconformity
surface, shown in Fig. 9 were based on the limited stratigraphic
evidence described above and incorporate two burial phases and
one or more denudational phases. The initial burial phase, beginning at 300 Ma, represents the deposition of the Karoo sequence,
and the second represents the Etendeka lava sequence beginning
at 130 Ma, with maximum burial depths being achieved by
120 Ma. An initial geothermal gradient of 25 C km 1 was
assumed. The thermal effects of the Etendeka magmatism were
approximated by simulating the addition of 10 km of basaltic
magma to the base of the crust (35 km), between 130 Ma and
120 Ma. It was also assumed that all samples had zero initial age
at 500 Ma, but for most samples, the predicted AFTA parameters
are relatively insensitive to this initial age. The AFTA results predicted by these models are most sensitive to the maximum palaeotemperatures achieved and the time of cooling from these
temperatures. The thermal models were all calculated using the
simple one dimensional numerical scheme that was described in
detail in Brown et al. (1994b) and were designed with the following important observations in mind:
1. Some areas of the present land surface represent a Late Palaeozoic glacial surface overlain in places by Permo-Caboniferous
sediments.
2. Outcropping basement rocks have been exposed to a range of
Late Mesozoic palaeotemperatures, which must have exceeded
110  10 C for some samples, which imply that substantial
denudation must have occurred during the Cretaceous. This is
true even if palaeogeothermal gradients were signicantly elevated relative to the present values of 1824 C km 1.
3. The AFTA data for many of the samples indicate that accelerated
cooling from these palaeotemperatures was initiated at
70 Ma.
4. Limited information from the offshore Walvis basin indicates a
thick (>4 km) Late Cretaceous clastic sedimentary section.
5. The limited terrestrial Cenozoic geology indicates a Palaeogene
(or older) age for the Namib Unconformity Surface and a significant increase in the rate of denudation of the escarpment
region during the Miocene is suggested by the Karpenkliff Conglomerate Formation.
5.2.1. Details of the regional thermal models
The maximum depth of burial in the coastal region model
(Fig. 9a) is 2.5 km, and comprises 1.5 km of Karoo sediments
and 1 km of Etendeka lavas. Three denudational phases were
included. The rst between 120 Ma and 75 Ma, immediately following the Etendeka magmatic episode, removing 1 km of section
at a rate of 22 m Ma 1. The second denudational phase, between
75 Ma and 65 Ma, removed 2.5 km of section at a rate of
250 m Ma 1, and the last phase from 65 Ma to the present removed
1 km. This implies that 2 km of the total of 4.5 km of denuded section comprised pre-Karoo basement rocks. It seems reasonable to
expect that denudation of the coastal region began during the early

33

stages of continental rifting during the Early Cretaceous, but the
AFTA data indicates that most of the cooling occurred at 70 Ma.
The inland region model (Fig. 9a) uses the same burial history as
the coastal region model, having a total burial depth of 2.5 km. The
total depth of section removed by the two denudational phases is
3 km. The rst phase occurs between 75 Ma and 65 Ma and
removes 1.5 km of section at a rate of 150 m Ma 1 and the second,
which begins at 25 Ma, also removes 1.5 km but at a slower rate of
60 m Ma 1. This second phase of denudation is required in order to
allow the samples now at the surface to have remained at moderately elevated temperatures after initially cooling at 70 Ma, but it
is not well constrained by the AFTA data, and cosmogenic isotope
studies (Cockburn et al., 2000; Bierman and Caffee, 2001) indicate
that Tertiary erosion rates were likely lower (c. 515 m Ma-1)
across this region of the margin. The timing of this second denudational phase coincides with the proposed Miocene increase in the
rate of denudation of the escarpment region inland of the Kuisib
drainage basin (Ward, 1987) and so it is possible there were short
lived phases of increased river incision and erosion through the
Tertiary, but at a scale undetectable by the AFTA thermochronometer. The Gamsberg region model (Fig. 9b) is identical to the inland
region model except that magmatic underplating was not included
in the calculation of the thermal history. Magmatic underplating
was not included in the Gamsberg model because it is the region
most distant from the hypothesised Early Cretaceous location of
the Tristan mantle plume, and would thus have been on the
periphery of the predicted region of magmatic underplating
(White and McKenzie, 1989).
The Kamanjab region model (Fig. 9b) incorporates two burial
phases, similar to the other models, but with less section being
deposited during each burial phase. The rst burial phase represents 1 km of Karoo sediment and the second represents 0.5 km
of Etendeka lavas. There is only a single denudational phase which
begins at 75 Ma, and removes the 1.5 km section deposited earlier,
between then and the present. Magmatic underplating was
included for this model. To simulate the thermal history of samples
from the central region that may have experienced the more localised effects of the sub-volcanic intrusions, the inland region model
was run with the depth of magmatic underplating reduced to only
10 km. While this is clearly an unrealistic underplating scenario, it
does provide a means of generating a relatively short lived thermal
event similar to that which might be experienced by a sample
within the contact aureole of a large magmatic intrusion.
5.2.2. Discussion of the modelling results
The thermal models illustrated in Fig. 9 were used to calculate
the thermal histories for a series of successively deeper points,
spaced at 250 m intervals, with the rst point being at the surface
prior to the initiation of the rst denudational phase. These series
of thermal histories were then used to calculate the AFTA parameters for hypothetical crustal proles using an apatite ssion track
annealing model (Laslett et al., 1987). The modelled apparent apatite ssion track ages for these proles are shown in Fig. 10, plotted
against initial sample depth, rather than nal elevation. This allows
an estimated depth of denudation to be read directly from these
prole diagrams for any given apparent ssion track age. For each
sample location, point estimates of the amount of denudation can
then be read from the appropriate prole. This procedure is illustrated schematically (Fig. 11) for a generalised northsouth and
an eastwest cross-section. The modelled proles have been superimposed onto the topographic cross sections such that an appropriate apatite ssion track age occurs at the present land surface.
Note that the age scale for the 1-dimensional modelled proles is
not equivalent to distance.
We chose to use the Laslett et al. (1987) ssion track annealing
model and a constant standard apatite composition (Durango

Fig. 9. Burial and thermal histories for the Coastal and Inland (a) models and the Kamanjab and Gamsberg (b) thermal models. Seeing that the maximum depth, and not the
detailed burial history, is the most important factor in determining the thermal history in these models the effect of sediment compaction was ignored. Depths to selected
isotherms (spaced at 20 C intervals) are shown on the burial history plots. For all models, except the Gamsberg model, the thermal effects of magmatic underplating
(Etendeka magmatism?) cause a transient increase in the thermal gradient and so the isotherms move to shallower depths and subsequently relax back towards their
original depth. Note that the advective effect of sedimentation or denudation causes a minor decrease or increase, respectively, in the near surface thermal gradient. The
model curves shown represent a vertical series samples regularly spaced at a depth interval of 0.5 km.

present mean land surface in each region and the vertical scale represents depth below an initial mean land surface appropriate for that region. Measured apatite ssion track
ages can then be used to derive point estimates of the depth of denudation by reading off the depth of denudation from the appropriate model prole.

apatite) for all models and believe this is justied and sensible in
this case because it enables the predictions of the different process
based thermal histories to be compared between different models,
and also between different areas. We do acknowledge though that
specic samples may have behaved differently in detail from our
standard Durango apatite composition (depending on the actual
Cl content of the apatite). However, the purpose of this study

was not to model the thermal histories of each sample site in precise detail, but rather to use the whole data set to try and constrain
the broad pattern, and timing, of cooling across the study area in a
self consistent manner. From our understanding of the published
multi-composition annealing models (e.g. Ketcham et al., 1999,
2007), and our own experience of using these, we believe that
the model thermal histories derived here are unlikely to be in error

36

R. Brown et al. / Journal of African Earth Sciences 100 (2014) 2041

by more than a maximum of 10 C or so (likely less), and so any
renement arising from using more complex composition based
annealing models will not materially change our key conclusions.
We note also that using the form of the age prole, and the time
of the so called break-in-slope alone, may not be good indicator
of the timing of cooling (e.g. Prenzel et al., 2013) and so viable thermal models were constrained using both the form of the prole as
well as the goodness of t of the actual AFTA parameters (i.e. age
and track length distributions) for individual samples. Clearly,
thermal histories could be derived for the observed data using
the more conventional data driven inversion and optimisation
approach (e.g. Gallagher, 2012), and this will certainly be the focus
of our ongoing work aimed at analysing the more precise detail,
subtle variations and spatial patterns of individual sample thermal
histories.
For the purpose of comparing the modelled AFTA results with
the measured AFTA data from along the OkahandjaSwakopmund
transect, a composite model prole was constructed comprising
segments from the Coastal, Inland and Kamanjab regional models
(Fig. 12). The upper 2 km of the composite prole is taken from
the Kamanjab regional model, the middle 2 km from the inland
regional model and the lower 2 km section from the coastal model.
The two modelled proles shown for the Gamsberg prole were
generated by running the Gamsberg model with an initial age of
500 Ma and 350 Ma, respectively.
Seeing that the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect samples
were collected over a horizontal distance of several hundred kilometres (see Fig. 3), and that the point estimates of the depth of
denudation for each sample ranges from 4.5 km at the coast to
1.25 km inland, the present sample elevations for these samples
do not reect their relative initial depths. To reconstruct the relative initial crustal depths for the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect
samples it is necessary to backstack the denuded section (Brown,
1991). This is achieved by calculating the amount of isostatic
rebound expected at each sample point, given the estimated denudation at that point, and subtracting this from the present elevation. Having done this, the relative crustal depths can then be
normalised in such away as to superimpose the reconstructed prole onto the modelled prole (Fig. 12e and f). When this backstacking procedure is followed a good correspondence is achieved
between the composite modelled prole and the measured AFTA
data from the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect. The backstacking
calculations were conducted using an Airy local isostatic compensation model. The generally good correlation between the modelled AFTA results and the measured AFTA data for this transect
provides support for the three proposed thermal history styles
incorporated in the composite modelled prole. Further support
is provided by the generally good correlation between the predicted and measured distributions of conned track lengths (see
Fig. 6a and b).
The samples from the Gamsberg prole were collected over a
much smaller horizontal distance (<100 km) and the range of
point estimates for the depth of denudation for these samples is
also relatively small (2.5 to 3.5 km). The amount of isostatic
rebound will thus be similar for all these samples and the present
sample elevations are therefore likely to closely approximate the
relative crustal depths for this prole. For this reason the sample
elevations were simply normalised in such a way as to superimpose the measured AFTA data onto the modelled proles shown
in Fig. 12c and d. The elevations for the three highest samples were
reduced by 700 m prior to converting the elevations to depths. This
assumes that a fault exists between the upper three samples and
the lower part of the prole (see Fig. 5). Again, the correspondence

Fig. 12. Comparison between the measured AFTA data (solid symbols) and the
model results (open symbols). The modelled AFTA parameters for each of a vertical
series of hypothetical samples have been plotted against the maximum depth
attained by each sample, that is, the depth prior to the initiation of denudation. The
relative depths for the measured AFTA data points shown in panels a through d
represent the present sample elevations. The sample elevations were normalised so
as to superimpose the measured AFTA proles with the modelled proles (simply
by adding an appropriate constant). The OkahandjaSwakopmund model prole
(panels a, b and e, f) is a composite model prole, derived from the Coastal, Inland
and Kamanjab models. The upper 2 km section is from the Kamanjab model (large
open circles), the middle 2 km section from the Inland model (open squares) and
the bottom 2 km section is from the Coastal model (small open circles). The two
modelled proles compared with the GamsbergGaub river prole (c, d) were both
derived from the burial history shown in Fig. 9b, but represent initial ages of
350 Ma (open squares) and 500 Ma (open circles), respectively. Note that the lower
section (ages <300 Ma) is effectively the same for both of these proles, indicating
that the measured AFTA parameters (for samples analysed) are insensitive to the
initial age. The OkahandjaSwakopmund transect was collected over a horizontal
distance of 300 km (Fig. 3) and the estimated depth of denudation ranges from
1 km in the interior to P45 km at the coast. Consequently, the present, relative
sample elevations are unlikely to represent the original relative sample depths
because of differential, denudational isostatic rebound of the surface along the
transect. The relative depths for the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect samples
were adjusted by backstacking the denuded section (predicted by the composite
modelled prole in panel a), assuming local isostatic compensation (Brown, 1991).
This adjustment simply subtracts the isostatic rebound component from the
present sample elevation. The effect of the backstacking adjustment is to stretch
out the relative sample depths so that depths of younger samples are increased
relative to depths of older samples, and thus reinstating the true relative structural
depths. Using the backstacked depths for the OkahandjaSwakopmund transect
provides a better t with the modelled prole (panels e and f) than that obtained
using the uncorrected depths (panels a and b).

between the modelled AFTA results and the measured data is generally good. However, two of the measured mean conned track
lengths are signicantly longer than that predicted for the equivalent sample depths. For both these samples the number of track
lengths measured is too low (13 and 14 tracks, respectively) to provide an accurate estimate of the mean length. Also, the biased nature of the conned track length measurement procedure (Laslett
et al., 1982, 1984; Green, 1988) would be expected to over predict
the mean track length for samples with an insufcient number of
conned track lengths.

6. Conclusions and geodynamic implications
The ssion track data presented in this paper place some important new constraints on the post-Damara thermal history of the
shallow crust in northern Namibia. The apatite ssion track ages
for Damaran metasediments and granites range from 450 Ma to
70 Ma, and the relationship between apatite age and the distribution of conned track lengths within each sample, indicates that
most of the samples experienced a signicant acceleration in cooling rate, beginning at 70 Ma. The results of the thermal modelling
have shown that this episode of cooling must be associated with a
substantial increase in the rate of crustal denudation, even if magmatic underplating of the crust, associated with the Etendeka magmatism, had given rise to transient elevated palaeogeothermal
gradients.
The total depth of Late Mesozoic denudation, implied by the
range of maximum palaeotemperatures estimated from the AFTA
results, varies from over 4.5 km near the coast to about 1 km
for inland regions. These estimates of the depth of denudation
require a much more extensive and thicker Karoo sedimentary
and/or Etendeka lava sequence than is presently preserved in
northern Namibia, given that the present land surface represents

12

a pre-Karoo glacial surface in places. This has important implications for original extent of the ParanEtendeka ood basalt province, implying as it does that the present asymmetry in the
distribution of the volcanic rocks between southeastern Brazil
and Namibia may be more apparent than real. This apparent
asymmetry, generated by differential denudation, between the volumes of basalt represented by the Etendeka and Paran volcanic
provinces was also referred to by Cox (1989).
The timing of accelerated cooling (and denudation) post-dates
the initial rifting leading to the opening of the South Atlantic oceanic basin by about 50 Ma, and is broadly synchronous with the
Late Cretaceous episode of transcontinental, intraplate deformation documented in West, Central and East Africa. The cause of this
deformation has been attributed to the stresses, resulting from differential opening between the Central and South Atlantic ocean
basins, being transferred along oceanic fracture zones and dissipated as a combination of strike slip and extensional faulting
within the continental interior (e.g. Fairhead, 1988; Fairhead and
Binks, 1991; Binks and Fairhead, 1992). The coincidence between
this period of plate motion change, within the South Atlantic Ocean
basin, and the accelerated crustal cooling documented within
northern Namibia, suggests a causative link between these two
episodes. The distinctive spatial pattern (Fig. 13) and timing of
cooling recorded within the Damara region of Namibia indicates
that intracontinental deformation similar to that documented
elsewhere in Africa at this time extended into the southern
sub-Saharan African continent. This deformation may well enable
resolution of the geometric problems related to mist/overlap
between South America and Africa for plate tectonic models of
the South Atlantic (e.g. Eagles, 2007; Torsvik et al., 2009;
Aslanian et al., 2009; Aslanian and Moulin, 2012).
If the dominant period of cooling at 70 Ma occurred in
response to an acceleration in denudation rate at this time, it
follows that a signicant increase in the mean topographic relief

Fig. 13. Map illustrating the pattern of apatite ssion track age across northern Namibia. The map was generated for the combined results from this study and published data
from Haack (1976, 1983), Luft et al. (2005), Raab (2001) and Raab et al. (2002, 2005). On a regional scale there is a remarkable correlation between the pattern of apatite
ssion track age and the regional NESW structural trend of the Damara metamorphic belt. The youngest ages occur along the coast and within the central region of the
Damara metamorphic belt further inland and the ages increase towards the north and the south. The age pattern shown here, and the discrete timing of cooling during
the Late Cretaceous, synchronous with similar intracontinental deformation elsewhere in Africa, suggest that reactivation of the regional structures have inuenced the
denudation pattern and hence low temperature thermal history of the crust in northern Namibia.

38

R. Brown et al. / Journal of African Earth Sciences 100 (2014) 2041

must have also occurred at this time, given that local relief appears
to be the dominant control on denudation rate (Ahnert, 1970; Pinet
and Souriau, 1988; Summereld, 1991). Increased local relief, caused
by tectonic reactivation of these pre-existing basement structures,
could therefore be invoked as a viable cause of the proposed acceleration in the rate of denudation. A similar argument was used to
explain the substantial (56 km) Pleistocene denudation of the King
Range, which occurs along the San Andreas transform fault in southern California, implied by the very young (<1 Ma) apatite ssion track
ages from this region (Dumitru et al., 1991).
As proposed by Moore et al. (2008) and Jelsma et al. (2009)
reactivation of these lithospheric scale structures, during the Late
Cretaceous, also provides an explanation for the patterns of occurrence of kimberlitic and other related alkaline magmatism within
southern Africa at this time (Marsh, 1973; Moore, 1976), such as
the Gibeon kimberlite eld in central Namibia (Reid et al., 1990).
Small to moderate amounts of lithospheric extension and thinning
and hence decompression, associated with the intracontinental
deformation, may be sufcient to produce the low degrees of partial melting required for the generation of alkaline (kimberlitic)
magmas. Particularly, seeing that the mantle beneath central
Namibia may have been anomalously hot due to the presence of
the Vema and Discovery mantle plumes beneath this region at
70 Ma (Reid et al., 1990). Also, the reactivation of the steep, lithospheric scale structures would provide access for the eruption of
these magmas, although this is not necessarily required by some
small fraction melt segregation models (McKenzie, 1985). This
broad correlation between timing of phases of kimberlite emplacement in southern Africa and accelerated phases of erosion during
the early and late-mid Cretaceous has been documented elsewhere
in South Africa (Tinker et al., 2008).
The broad correlation between the regional distribution of apatite ssion track ages and major tectonic structures in northern
Namibia (Fig. 13) supports the view that reactivation of these
structures had an important inuence on the Late Mesozoic thermal history of the crust. Our new data, combined with previous
results and the thermal modelling constraints provide a robust
and important rst order measure of the scale and style of Late
Cretaceous tectonism within southern Africa, and suggest that
other segments of the DamaraOkavangoMwembeshi shear
zones may have also been reactivated during this period.
