OF THE POSTMATERIALIST
THESIS

Many social scientists have arguedthatmajorpolitical changes have occurredin the
postindustrialsocieties of WesternEurope,NorthAmerica, and Australasiasince the
1960s. These changes includepartisandealignmentaccompaniedby a breakdownin
traditionalpolitical orientations,the appearanceof "new social movements,"and
formsof politicalaction. One of the most influential
increasinguse of non-traditional
account of the origins of the "New Politics" is RonaldInglehart's"postmaterialist"
thesis. Analyzingdatafromthe PoliticalAction surveys, we test two centralpropositions of the postmaterialistthesis: thatpostmaterialismconstitutesan emergingand
categoricallydistincttype of valuecommitmentin these societies; and thata commitment to postmaterialismleads to a rejectionof the state as a meansof accomplishing
policy objectives. Neither of these propositionsis supported.The analyses instead
provideevidence for an alternativeaccountthatwe characterizeas "valuepluralism,"
and they show furtherthateven citizenswith postmaterialistvalues endorsethe intervention of state institutionsto achievedesiredpolitical outcomes.
A major paradox in the politics of the postindustrial societies of Western Europe, North
America and Australasia in the period since World WarII is that pressure for social change
has often come not from the working class and other groups struggling solely to improve
their material well-being-as Marxist theory postulated-but rather from other groups of
actors concerned with issues of culture and identity (Habermas 1981, 1987; Touraine
1981). The student movements of the 1960s, the environmental and feminist movements
of the last two decades, and the peace and anti-nuclear movements of the 1980s provide
vivid examples of this expansion in the range of issues motivating protest politics (Carroll
1992; Cohen 1985; Eder 1985; Kitschelt 1985; Melucci 1989). Alongside the rise of these
"new" social movements, the apparent decline of traditional political parties and the
willingness of many citizens to organize themselves outside of established political institutions has led to the widespread use of terms such as "crisis," "dealignment," "overload,"

A growing numberof researchershave construedthese developmentsas indicatingthe

importanceof the changing social structurein the developmentof the New Politics
(Eyermanand Jamison1991; Kreisi1989; Offe 1985; Pinardand Hamilton1989). "Neoconservative"culturalcritics of the New Politics have arguedthat these changesfollow
from the replacementof traditionalby hedonisticvalues which threatenthe stabilityof
bourgeois capitalism (Bell 1976; Kristol 1983). "New social movement"and "postMarxist"theoriesstressthe declineof socialistpoliticalpartiesand tradeunionorganizations, arguingthatthe principalaxes of politicalconflicthave shiftedfromone dominated

Offe 1985;Touraine1981). Neo-Marxistapproachesarguethatthe new politicalconjuncture reflects the changing accumulationneeds of contemporarycapitalist economies

While these theorieshavestimulatedconsiderabledebateaboutthe originsandextentof

collaborators.In a series of booksandarticlesbasedon an extensiveset of cross-national
surveys fielded in ten or morecountriesin every year since 1973, Ingleharthas set forth
one of the most ambitious and comprehensiveattemptsto understandcontemporary
patternsof politicalchange (Abramsonand Inglehart1986, 1992; Inglehart1971, 1977,

INGLEHART'SPOSTMATERIALISTTHESIS:
AN OVERVIEW

Ingleharthypothesizesthatin recentdecadespoliticalchangesin the "advancedindustrial
societies" can be traced to a shift in "the values of Western publics .

.

. [from] an

overwhelming emphasis on materialwell-being and physical security toward greater
emphasison the qualityof life"(1977, p. 3). Amongthe key changeshe identifiesare the
apparentdecline of political conflictbased aroundtraditionalleft/rightand social class
cleavages, the rise of new social movementsand green politicalparties,a growingfocus
on individualautonomyand "lifestyle"issues, andthe increasingvulnerabilityof bureaucraticwelfare states (Inglehart1990a, Chap. 1). Utilizing surveydatagatheredover a 20
values
year period, Inglehartarguesthat older cohortswith predominantly"materialist"
are being displaced by youngergenerationswith increasingly"postmaterialist"
values.
This value shift, along with a correspondingincrease in the "cognitiveskills" of the
younger, bettereducatedcohortsis said to accountfor changes in political life since the
1960s, changes which amountto nothingless thana "silentrevolution"(Inglehart1977).

The rise of postmaterialistvalues, accordingto Inglehart,underliesthe changingpolitical dynamicsthat have given rise to the New Politics in the periodsince the 1960s. He
argues, for example, that it is postmaterialistswho are primarilyactive in new social
movementsand othertypesof non-institutional
protest(1990a, Chap. 11). The decline in
religious beliefs among youngercohorts reflects the spread of secular postmaterialist
values (1990a, pp. 185-186). The growthof a "second"left, rooted in the middle class
and concerned with non-economicissues, can also be traced to postmaterialchange
(1977, pp. 267-284; 1990a, pp. 259ff.; Inglehartand Rabier1986; cf. Lipset 1981, pp.
503-523). Finally,the crisis of welfarestatesandcitizens'growinglack of confidencein
their nationalgovernmentsreflectpostmaterialist
sentiments(Inglehart1990a, pp. 9-11).
OF VALUES
A CRITIQUEOF INGLEHART'S
MEASUREMENT
Inglehart'spostmaterialistthesishingeson a key claim aboutvalues, or more specifically
about the relationshipbetweenmaterialistandpostmaterialistvalues in mass publics. He
assumes not only that materialistand postmaterialistvalues can be conceptuallydistinguished fromone another,but thatpeople endorsethem in such a way as to resultin two
and "matedistinctand internallyhomogeneouscategoriesof citizens:"postmaterialists"
rialists."3To establish this claim, Inglehartutilizes a 4-item index to measure value
prioritiesin his crolss-nationalsurveys.4Forthis index, a respondentis presentedwith a
and the othertwo as
set of four items, two of which are designatedas "postmaterialist"
"materialist."The respondentis askedto choose which(s)he thinksis the most important

Whatis notableaboutthis schemeis the logical dependencebetweenthe responsecategories: respondentsareforcedto choose a "toppriority"and, if they choose a "postmaterialist" item, by definitionalfiat they cannotbe classified as a materialist(and vice-versa).
This procedurepresupposesthat postmaterialistand materialistvalues are necessarily
disjunctive, and accordinglythatcitizens will not simultaneouslyaffirmboth materialist
and postmaterialistvalues.
Moreover,becauseof the logicaldependencebetweenitem selection, Inglehart'sindex
also cannot differentiatebetween respondentswho embrace postmaterialistvalues and
categorically reject materialistvalues-the extreme postmaterialistposition-versus
those who embrace postmaterialistvalues while simultaneouslyendorsingmaterialist
value the postvalues. Similarly,it is not clearwhetheror not Inglehart's"materialists"
materialistitems, haveno preference,or areactivelyopposed.These areseriousflawsfor
Inglehart'sdata analysis. Because his index assumes that one cannot simultaneously
embraceboth postmaterialistandmaterialistvalues, the fundamentalquestionof whether
postmaterialistand materialistvalues necessarilyexclude one another-and hence that
there are two discreteclasses of citizens-is simply assumed.Thereis, in otherwords, a
question-beggingelementin Inglehart'sargument:he wants, on the one hand,to demonand "materialist"

In additionto problemsrelatingto the logic of Inglehart'sindex, it is not clearthatthe

Insofaras Inglehart'smaterialistitems are typicallyaboutrising pricesand "maintaining

into questionthe evidence for his postmaterialistthesis. But even if Inglehart'sfindings
cannotbe takenat face valuedueto thesemeasurementproblems,it neverthelesscould be
the case thata new type of valuecommitment-one which is categoricallydistinctfrom
older patterns-is emergingand becoming dominantamong the citizens of advanced
industrialsocieties. Inglehart'stheoreticalhunchescould, in otherwords, turnout to be
true, despite the inherentflaws of his measures.In the next section, we evaluate this
possibility by first devising and then carryingout a systematictest of the thesis which
avoids the precedingflaws.
TESTINGTHEPOSTMATERIALIST
THESIS
and "postAccordingto the theoreticalassumptionsof Inglehart'sthesis, "materialism"
materialism"representcategoricallydistinct types of values and citizens can thus be
classified as postmaterialistsor materialists.These assumptionsimply that citizens' responses to survey questions about values are a function of their membershipwithin
categories of a latent discretevariable.Inglehart'simplicit scaling model is thus unidimensional(see Inglehart1977, p. 52, fn. 21; 1990a, p. 144 for explicit statementsof
unidimensionality).Accordingto this model, there are two discretecategoriesof "postvaluecommitmentsat extremeends of the unidimensional
materialist"and "materialist"
scale, with a residual"mixed"class of respondentsfalling betweenthese poles.5 As we
subsequentlydemonstrate,this categoricalscaling model can be parameterizedwithin a
log-linear frameworkand tested against alternativemodels that embody a competing
thesis aboutthe structureof values.
The theoreticalassumptionsinformingInglehart'spostmaterialistindexrepresentonly
one possible view of the structureof values. In this section of the paper,we consideran

interpretationthe "value pluralism"thesis, and it leads to a differentmodel of values

tion of chance, ratherthanthe effect of citizens' incumbencywithinone of two mutually
exclusive categoriesof values (as is assumedby the postmaterialistthesis). Valuesare,
accordingto this modelingapproach,a matterof individualcitizens'preferencesand they
are consequentlyarrangedin unpredictable
fashionsthatdo not resultin any generaltypes
of value commitment.
The Value Priority Items
For the analyses developedin this paper, we utilize data for the United States, the
Netherlands,and WestGermanyfromthe PoliticalAction I (BarnesandKaase 1983) and
PoliticalAction II surveys(Jennings1991).These surveyswere conductedusingnational

probabilitysamples, and we utilizethe two cross-sectionalversionsof the surveysin this
analysis.7Both surveyscontaintwo sets of value priorityitems. The firstof these sets is a
batteryof eight items which ask respondentsto ranktheir threehighestand threelowest
prioritiesand which were repeatedat bothcross-sectionsof the study(i.e. in 1973-1974
and again in 1979-1981). The second set of twelve items were fielded as separate
questionsduringthe firstcross-sectionof the studyand then subsequentlyas components
of a twelve-itembatteryfor the study'ssecond cross-section.The fact thatthe thesevalue
priorityitems are part of a much larger(eight- or twelve-item) batteryin the Political
Action surveys-as opposed to the four-itembattery(availablein the Euro-barometer
surveys)to which Inglehartusuallylimits his analysis-is especiallycritical.This means
thatwhile respondentsmustmakesome trade-offswhen rankingtheirvalue priorities,the
larger numberof items generatesmore inter-valuecomparisons,therebyreducingany
(biasing) effects of particularitems that reference spurious values.8 In sum, a larger
numberof items coupledwith carefulitem selection maximizesthe chancesfor accurate
measurement.
To furtherminimizeany forced-choiceeffects, we treatthe actualitems we analyzeas
separatequestionsby selectinga single pairof items fromeach batteryof items (thatis, a
and "materialist"items from each of the two batteries).This
pair of "postmaterialist"
is
procedure accomplishedby coding each questionabout a value priorityas a separate
survey item: if a respondentranksa given value priorityas his/her first, second, or third
choice, the item is coded "1"(and"0"otherwise).In contrastwith Inglehart'sown index,
scores under this coding scheme reflect only that a respondentrates a given issue as
important,not that (s)he necessarilyrates other issues as unimportant.This coding of
and"materialitems thusallows us to test whethercitizensdo in fact see "postmaterialist"
ist" goals as reflectingan intrinsictrade-off,or alternatively,whethercitizens view postmaterialismandmaterialismas referencingcompatiblevalues whichhavean unsystematic
-as opposed to a discrete-relationship with one another.9
Althoughthe PoliticalAction value priorityitems are superiorin contentto the fouritem battery used by Inglehart,some items are sounder than others as measuresof
postmaterialismand materialism.'0Out of the first eight items, there are five suitable
items for analysis."IOut of the second set, thereare six suitableitems (threematerialist
and threepostmaterialist)for analysis.12 But analyzingthe eleven items(five fromthe first
battery,six fromthe secondbattery)in tabularformis neithernecessarynordesirable.The
cross-tabulationof the eleven items creates, for one thing, an enormous numberof
sampling zeros (virtuallythe entire table), making analysis virtuallyimpossible.'3We
found in practicethat tablescomposedof more than four items resultedin problemsfor
statisticalinferencein virtueof emptycells. Fortunately,a set of four items-two materialist and two postmaterialist-providesa succinct basis for testing the postmaterialist
and value pluralismtheses againstone another.
The items we analyze in this paperare arrangedin the form of 24 contingencytables,
in which two of the items are drawnfrom the first batteryand the other two are drawn
from the second batteryof items. However, because neither the postmaterialist(nor
materialist)items we considerare identicalin content to one another,it is desirableto
analyze more than a single set of four items in the hopes of generatingrobustresults.
For this reason, we have selectedtwo sets of (four) items for our analyses. Eachof these
16-fold tables of items is summarizedin Table2. The two postmaterialistitems fromthe
first contingencytable of items representthe best overall approximationof Inglehart's

theoretical definition of postmaterialism as concerned with "qualitative" ideas of wellbeing and the importance of individual autonomy. The two postmaterialist items from
the second contingency table of items represent the next best overall approximation of
postmaterialism. As already discussed, the materialist items typically found in the Inglehart's four-item battery conflate materialism with authoritarianism (see also Flanagan
1987). To provide a better assessment of the relevance of materialist values, the first pair
of items we use (jobs, income equality) raise historically important issues about material
well-being without implying authoritarianism.The second pair of items (crime, economic growth) provide alternative measures of personal and societal well-being.
The availability of data for three countries (the United States, the Netherlands, and
West Germany) allows us to test the postmaterialist claim about the structure of value
commitment in three different national contexts. The existence of data at two separate
points in time (for the United States and the Netherlands)14 is also central to the logic of
our analyses in that it allows us to test the dynamic element of Inglehart's argument:
whether the postmaterialist shift has grown in tandem with the maturation of the postWorld War II birth cohort. We test this key claim about the cohort-value relationship into
our statistical analyses by stratifying the sample into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive birth cohorts: citizens born 1945 and after (the "young" cohort) versus those born
prior to 1945 (the "old" cohort). In the United States, the young cohort is composed of
respondents ages 28 and younger in 1973 (ages 29 and younger in 1974 in the Netherlands), and ages 37 and younger in 1981 (ages 36 and younger in the Netherlands).'15 Our
comparative research design thus yields 20 contingency tables for the first cross-section's
analyses (10 tables for the first four items and 10 tables of identical dimensions for the
second four items) and 16 tables for the second cross-section's analyses (8 tables for the
first four items and 8 tables of identical dimensions for the second four items).

Log-Linear Models of Value Structure

In the analyses thatfollow, we parameterizeboth Inglehart'spostmaterialistthesis and
our alternativevalue pluralismthesis withina log-linearframeworkfor contingencytable
analysis. Duncan's work on responseconsistency models (see Duncan 1979; Duncan,
Sloane and Brody 1982)discussesa set of log-linearparameterswith whichto understand
the mechanismsthat give rise to latentclasses'6 of respondentswith homogeneousresponse probabilities(such as those Ingleharthypothesizesas characterizingcitizens with
"postmaterialist"or "materialist"values). Because the resulting log-linear models of
postmaterialistvalue structureare inferentiallyconnected to simpler models of value
pluralism, these two generalclasses of models can be readily comparedto adjudicate
between the postmaterialistand value pluralismtheses.
The simplestmodel of values-and the firstlog-linearspecificationof the valuepluralism thesis-is the model of statisticalindependence.The log-linearmodel of statistical
independencecan be expressedin the following equation, in which nikl is the expected
frequencyfor cell (ij,k,1) in the table of items:

representedby the unsubscriptedlambdaterm is the grand mean total; as in most loglinearmodels, it is not of substantiveinterestin and of itself, indicatingonly the natural
by
log of the averagefrequencyforcells in the table. The lambdaswhichare superscripted
M,, M2, P,, and P2 are the one-way marginaleffects. On our notation,M, indicatesthat
the first item representsa materialistvalue priority,M2 representsthe second materialist
value priority, and so on. Because there are four (dichotomous)items in the current
analyses, there are four one-waymarginaleffects positedthe model of independence(as
there also are for all the models analyzedin this paper).Model I assumes thatcitizens'
responses to survey questionsaboutvalue prioritiesare statisticallyindependentof one
another(i.e., that there is no intrinsicassociationbetween responsesto a given pair of
items once the marginaldistributionsof individualitems have been takeninto account).
The modelof statisticalindependenceis a simple modelof value pluralismin thatit denies
not only that there are any latent classes of value commitment("materialist,""postbetweenparticumaterialist,"or otherwise),butalso thatthereareany inter-relationships
lar values. We accordinglytermit the model of "idiosyncraticvalues."
By adding two special parametersfor the four-way marginaleffects, the model of
independencecan readilybe modifiedto yield a first log-linearspecificationof the postmaterialistclaim aboutvalue structure.These two parametersgovern expectedfrequencies for the two combinationsof item responsesthat are indicativeof "materialist"

crete (but not exhaustive) categories of homogeneous values. The four-digit subscripts of
each of these parameters identify the specific item response combination to which they
pertain. The first parameter pertains to responses that rate the two materialist items as
unimportant (a "0" score) and the two postmaterialist items as important (a "1" score).
Because the "0011" response combination pertains to a specific cell in the 16-fold table,
the inclusion of the lambda term which is subscripted by 0011 constrains the expected
frequency in this cell to equal the observed frequency under the model. The second
parameter (subscripted by 1100) pertains to the response combination "1100," indicating
an important ranking on both materialist items and unimportant rankings on both postmaterialist items. The expected frequency in this cell is also constrained to be equal to the
observed frequency by the model.
The inclusion of the two four-way marginal effect parameters of Model 2 represents the
main theoretical assumptions that inform Inglehart's interpretation of value structure (as
well as the methodological assumptions of his postmaterialist index). Under this log-linear
specification of postmaterialism, the expected frequency in the majority of the cells in the
24 table (14 of the 16) are governed by statistical independence, while only the two cells
representing the "postmaterialist"and "materialist"response patterns are governed by the

postmaterialist
"postmaterialists" and "materialists," this log-linear reconstruction of Inglehart's indexwhich we call the "postmaterialist values model"-can be construed as positing a latent
discrete variable with two discrete and internally homogeneous categories that apply to a
logical subset of the population. "
The preceding specification of the postmaterialist thesis assumes that all association
between responses to the four items is a function of some respondents falling into one of
the two latent discrete categories of value commitment. However, as discussed by Duncan
(1979), it is not always the case that all association in a contingency table of k items is
equivalent to the k-way marginal effect. There can sometimes be additional association
between pairs of items that is necessary to parameterize in order to develop an empirically
adequate description of the data. In the current context, this would mean that there is a
residual (latent) category of respondents whose values are intrinsically "mixed." Following Duncan, we parameterize these additional patterns of association as the pairwise
effects captured by the two-way marginals. Inserting these additional parameters within
each of the two preceding models results in modified versions of both the postmaterialist
and value pluralism theses. As before, these modified log-linear models are inferentially
connected to the previous models, thereby allowing for nested comparisons to test the
significance of the two-way marginal effects. If the models containing these effects
improve the fit of the previous models, they indicate that residual association amongst the
items are a product of respondents who tend to endorse both materialist and postmaterialist priorities.

Model 4 is the modified version of the postmaterialist thesis. Model 4 is derived from
Model 2 (the simplified version of the postmaterialist thesis) by adding parameters for the
set of all two-way marginal effects for the value priority items. Because these six parameters are the same ones as included in Model 3, Models 3 and 4 enjoy a nested interrelationship and their fits can thus be directly compared. Model 4- like Model 2-posits
two mutually exclusive (but not exhaustive) latent categories of postmaterialist and materialist value commitment. But unlike Model 2-and like Model 3-Model 4 allows for
there to be other sources of inter-item association than those relating to the two internally
homogeneous "postmaterialist" and "materialist" categories.19 The inclusion of these
pairwise effects in the model represents the hypothesis that there is a residual category of
respondents with intrinsically mixed values. However, unlike Model 3, Model 4-which
we term the "postmaterialist + mixed values model"-assumes that only a fraction of
respondents have mixed values (i.e. that there are also two additional categories of
postmaterialist and materialist respondents).
Summary descriptions of the four models and their implied hypotheses are presented in
Table 3. Because Models 1 through 4 have numerous nested inter-relationships, they
provide a systematic basis for testing the value pluralism and postmaterialist against one
another. These nested relationships are expressed in the figure at the bottom of Table 3.
These nested relationships allow all pairs of models-except for Models 2 and 3-to be
directly compared with one another. This is done by partitioning the likelihood ratio chisquare statistic and testing its significance for the degrees of freedom resulting from the
difference between the degrees of freedom for the pair of models being compared.

Modeling Results
In Table 4, we report the fit of the four models of values to the data for the first set of
items among the young versus old cohorts in the United States in 1973 versus 1981.20
Partitioning the likelihood statistics to compare the models results in support for both
versions of the value pluralism thesis for the older American cohort in both 1973 and
1981. The structure of younger Americans' values in 1973 is best described by the simpler
version of the postmaterialist thesis (Model 2), but this outcome does not provide Inglehart's argument with much support, for by 1981, the young cohort's values are best
described by the simpler version of the value pluralism thesis (Model 1).
In Tables 5 and 6, we present the modeling results for the same cohorts and time periods
for the Netherlands and West Germany respectively. These results also support the value
pluralism but not the postmaterialist thesis. In three out of the four cohorts in the Netherlands, Model 3-the modified model of value pluralism-is preferred. In the fourth case,
Model I -the simple model of value pluralism-would be preferred (because none of the
other models improve over its fit). However, because Model l's own fit to the data is poor
(p = .03), none of the four models provides a satisfactory accounting of the data. Model
3, the "mixed values" model of value pluralism, provides the preferred description of the
data for both the West German cohorts.
Given these results for the first set of value priority items, we now analyze the data from

the second table of value priority items. As discussed in the preceding section of the
paper, the reason for this procedure is that in virtue of the internal complexity of values, it
is useful to have multiple indicators with which to corroborate results. We have accordingly carried out the analyses of the four log-linear models for the same countries, cohorts,
and time points for the second table of value priority items in Tables 7, 8, and 9. The
modeling results for the second table of items yield very similar results to those for the
first table of items. In six of the ten cases, both tables' results lead to identical inferences

1974-5 (Model 3 is preferredin item table,, Model 4 for item table2).These two cases
from the second table of items are interestingin theirown right, but they tend to cancel
one anotherout, favoringthe postmaterialistthesis in one case and the value pluralism
thesis in the other. For this reason, the two disagreeingcases have very little overall
impacton the emergingportraitof the structureof value commitmentamongcitizens of
the threecountriesunderinvestigation.In fact, given the heterogeneoussubjectmatterof
the postmaterialistand materialistitemsfromeach of the two tables, it is noteworthythat
there is so much congruencein the modelingresults. Whatthese resultsestablishis the
following: in only one of ten possiblecases (for each set of items)does the postmaterialist
claim aboutvalue structurereceivesupport.In eight of the remainingcases, the evidence
favors the value pluralismthesis. And in the final case, the data providean insufficient
basis for preferringModel 2 or 3 and hence adjudicatingbetween the two competing
theses.
The results from the log-linearanalyses of value priorityitems thus fail to provide
supportfor Inglehart'scategoricaldistinctionof "materialism"versus "postmaterialism"
as a descriptionof the structureof values in the UnitedStates, the Netherlands,or West
Germany.These resultsinsteadsupportour alternativethesis that these values are better
conceptualizedas compatiblewith one another,leading to a pluralistic,ratherthan a
discrete, mix of values among these publics. We also find no evidence of time trends
duringthe two periodsor thatcohort-specificsocializationleads to greaterpostmaterialist
value commitmentamongyoungercitizens in any of the threecountries.The absenceof
cohort differencesor time trends runs contraryto Inglehart'spredictionthat citizens'
values will increasinglyplace them within two categoricallydiscrete (and internally
homogeneous)camps.
Changing Values?
The modelingresultsof the previoussection answerthe questionof whetherthe structureof citizens'values leadsto two (latent)homogeneousanddiscretecategoriesof value
commitment.But these results do not yet speak to the question of whetherthe overall
distributionof values has changedover time. Answeringthe latterquestionis useful in
completingthe portraitwe aredevelopingof the structureof values amongmass publics,
and the precedingsection's modeling results establish that values should be analyzed
individually.In other words, endorsinga particular"postmaterialist"
prioritydoes not
necessarilymeanthata respondentalso endorsesthe otherpostmaterialistitem in the table
or that(s)he rejectsthe "materialist"
concernsreferencedby the two remainingitems. For
this reason, the one-way marginaldistributionof each item at a given point in time
providesa summaryof the level of supportamongthe public for a given priority.
In Table 10, we presentthe one-waymarginaldistributionof each of fourof the items
fromthe precedingsection'sanalyses(two postmaterialistandtwo materialist).Figuresin
columns are the proportionof respondentsin the young versus old cohortswho endorse
the value referencedby a specific item at each of the two points in time. As before, we
presentdatafor each of the threecountriesin the analyses.The overall storytold by the
measuresof supportfor each of the particularvalue prioritiessuggests that changes in
values havenot been as comprehensiveas predictedby Inglehart.Althoughthe figuresfor
the postmaterialistitemsdo show a greaterdegreeof changethanthose for the materialist
items, two cases of change relatingto postmaterialistitems actually show declining

An importantcorollaryto Inglehart'sclaims aboutchanges in the structureand distribution of values is his assertionthatthe rise of postmaterialistvalues is leadingto a decline

arguedin the New Politicsliterature(Laclauand Mouffe 1985;Magnusson1992;Magnusson and Walker1988;see Frankel1987;and Mooersand Sears 1992; for criticaldiscussions). But Inglehartgoes beyondnormativeclaims to assertthatcitizensin postindustrial
societies are in fact rejectingthe state as a solution to social problems. He arguesthat
althoughthe emergenceof welfarestates temperedthe inequitiesof laissez-fairecapitalism, growth in the welfarestate "hasbegun to reacha point of diminishingreturns. . .

correspondingquestionsabout governmentalresponsibility.Under a weaker interpretation, we would expect that while there may be some (positive) associationbetween
postmaterialistvalues and attributedgovernmentalresponsibility,it will be lesser in
magnitudethan the associationbetween materialistvalues and attributedgovernmental
responsibility.
Table 11 presentsthe resultsof our analysis in which we regressthe six governmental
responsibility items on the correspondingvalue priority items for each country.The
unstandardizedregressioncoefficientsare both large and statisticallysignificantfor each
item in each country.The coefficientsfor the postmaterialistitems areespeciallynoteworthy: they show that there is a large, positive associationbetween ratinga given postmaterialistconcern as importantand holding the state responsible for its realization.
Moreover,the magnitudeof associationrepresentedby the postmaterialistcoefficientsis
not typically less thanthatfor the materialistitems. Thereis no tendencyfor postmaterialist values to elicit less of an orientationto the statethanmaterialistvalues. In otherwords,
even for citizens who value "postmaterialist"
ends, the stateis seen as a properinstitutional arenathroughwhich to press for reforms.
To be sure, these findingsdo not meanthatthereis necessarilywidespreadsatisfaction
with current state institutionsor that respondentsdo not wish to see changes in the
delivery of stateservices. But the findingsdo call into questionInglehart'scontentionthat

these results show that they look to governmentinstitutionsto defend or promotethose

nature of value structures.We find that while there do tend to be significant interrelationshipsbetweenvaluepriorityitems, these relationshipsarebetterconceptualizedas
essentially randompatternsof (pairwise)association. The processes by which citizens
assign and rate values when they areconfrontedwith a host of prioritiesrarelyresultsin
the kind of consistencythat would be indicativeof membershipin latentcategoriesof

internallyhomogeneousvalue commitment,such as "postmaterialist"
Furthermore,not only do values within mass publics often tend to be intrinsically
"mixed,"thereis no evidenceof time trendsor cohort-specificpatternsof value structure
that would indicatea postmateralistturn. Ratherthan new prioritiesgeneratingdiscrete
and homogeneouscategoriesof valuecommitment,they lead insteadto idiosyncraticand
cross-cuttingrelationshipsbetweenspecificvaluepriorities.The marginalratesof change
on survey items representingspecificvalue prioritiesare telling in this context. We find
that less has changed about the aggregate-leveldistributionof values than Inglehart
hypothesizes.Materialprioritieshave been stable duringthe time period in questionfor
the two countriesthat have data at two points in time (the Netherlandsand the United
States). Postmaterialpriorities,for theirpart, have exhibitedsome change in the United
States, but what changes as have occurreddo not amountto a net increasein the popularityof these concerns.We concludethatvalues in general,and the distinctionbetween
and "materialist"
values in particular,providean insufficientbasis for

what

not changed about political life in the advanced

Moreover, because Inglehart'sargumentis premised on an a priori opposition of
and "materialist"values, he fails to theorize the processes by which
"postmaterialist"
"new" cultural prioritiesor political goals can oftentimes be integratedinto existing
politicalattitudesandorientations.This is an importantoversightbecausethereis, ceteris
paribus, some tendency for novel phenomenato become consolidatedinto the more
robust structuresthat organizecitizens' belief systems. The phenomenonof political
integrationshouldnot come as a completesurpriseto publicopinionresearcherswho have
shownhow enduringstructuressuchas citizens'partyidentificationor theirpoliticalaffect
providea centralsourceof organizationin mass politicalattitudes(e.g., Converse1964,
1970; Sniderman,Brody, and Tetlock 1991). However, it presentsa majortheoretical
anomaly for Inglehart'sanalyticalframework,given his assumptionthat contemporary
politicalconflictsare typicallyfueledby values. In this context, a fundamentaldrawback
of Inglehart'svalue-centeredapproachto understandingpolitics is that it ignores the
mediationof abstractvaluesby citizens'actualpoliticalpreferencesandorientations.The
key theoreticalproblemis thatwhile values specify thatcertainends of life areimportant
and worth realizing, they do not specify how an end is to be realized. Froma socialscientific perspective, the specific policy mechanisms and institutionalarrangements
people preferfor the realizationof theirvalues arejust as importantas underlyingvalues.
It is not enough to know, for example,that someone values equalityor a clean environment. A full-fledgedanalysisof politicalattitudesmustdiscernjust how far a personwill
go to realize these goals, and what means (s)he prefers for their realization.Because

562

Inglehart'spostmaterialistthesis is posed at a high level of abstraction-focussing on
values-it tends to ignore the more concrete, but ultimatelycritical, level of citizens'
policy attitudes,therebymakingit difficultto say anythingabout whetherand in what
ways political attitudeshave changedin the contemporaryera.
Our findings about the structuralcompatibilityof "materialist"and "postmaterialist"
priorities-and the pluralityof values-also call intoquestionInglehart'sassumptionthat
the materialistand postmaterialistaspects of issues can always be distinguished.As a
issues
consequence, it is not clear how real-lifepolitical strugglesover "postmaterialist"
can ever completelyavoidbecomingentangledwith "materialist"concerns.The specific
issues which Inglehartcites as examplesof well-developedpostmaterialiststruggles(such
as gender, the environment,religion, homosexuality,and abortion)do not appearprima
facie to invoke traditionallymaterialistissues. But althoughissues such as gender,race
and ethnicityraisequestionsaboutthe "ascriptive"bases of identity,they also often have
enviimportantmaterialcomponentsas well. For example, ostensibly "postmaterialist"
ronmentalconcernsare often connectedto materialissues, (as, for example, in the risks
for jobs and economic growththatthe establishmentof strictenvironmentalregulations
threaten)or in the distributionof costs (for example when poor communitiesbear a
disproportionateshareof environmentalhazards).
Finally, we find the corollaryto the postmaterialistclaim about shifting valuesInglehart'sassertionthat citizens who value postmaterialistgoals are opposed to the
extension of the bureaucraticstate institutions-is not supportedby the PoliticalAction
data. On those itemsin the surveyswherethe role of the state is posedalongsidequestions
about values, citizensexpressingpostmaterialistconcernsare also overwhelminglylikely
to couple those concerns with demandsfor the state to assume responsibilityfor their
realization.While it may be truethatthere is a growingand genericfrustrationwith the
inabilityof stateinstitutionsto speakto manyproblemsof the day, thesesentimentsdo not
necessarily imply that citizens find good reasons to categoricallyreject the state as a
policy-makinginstitution.Indeed,when it comes to theirown particulargoals, thereis a
strong tendency for citizens to bracketwhatevergeneral anti-statesentimentsthey may
have to call on the federalgovernmentto assume responsibilityfor social problems.
Postmaterialismand New Social Movements
In his recentwork, Inglehart(1990a, Chap. 11; 1990b)has arguedthathis analysisof
postmaterialismis congruentwith, and helps to explain, the emergenceof "new"social
movements in postindustrialsocieties. He argues that "Postmaterialistvalues underlie
manyof the new social movements-for Postmaterialistsemphasizefundamentallydifferent value prioritiesfrom those thathave dominatedindustrialsociety for many decades"
(1990a, p. 373).23The issues motivatingthese movementsand the rhetoricalflourishesof
some leadingactivistsin these movementsdo suggestsome measureof plausibilityfor the
postmaterialistthesis. The new movementsare not typically groundedin the material
struggle of subordinateeconomic classes or groups, and perhapsas a consequenceInglehart'swork has been often invokedby analystsstudyingthese movements(e.g., Betz
1990; Dalton and Kuechler1990;Ganzeboomand Flap 1989).
To what extent do "postmaterialist,"
as opposed to "materialist"values, inform new
social movement activism? In line with the analyses of values developed above, we
suggest that materialistconcernsare at least as centralto the new movementsas post-

Do Changing Values ExplainThe New Politics?

563

materialistends. These movementsoften emphasizeappeals to issues of personaland
societal security-i.e. to "material"
valuesin Inglehart'sscheme-in the recruitmentand
mobilizationof activists and supporters.The environmentaland ecological movements
that have appearedsince the 1960s often argue that impendingecological catastrophe
necessitatescitizen action (see e.g., Lewis 1992). Anti-nuclearpower campaignsstress
the potentiallydisastrousconsequencesof the releaseof radioactivematerialsfromnuclear power plants (see e.g., Joppke1993). Women'smovementsand activismoften center
directly on materialissues, such as in the comparableworthcampaign(see e.g., Blum
1991). Peace movementsare above all else aboutthe preventionof war, which always
poses a directthreatto personaland/orsocietal security(especially in the case of nuclear
war). While some activistsin all of these movementsmay envision a radicalremakingof
the social order,it does not follows thatthey (or otherparticipants)have no concernwith
personal well-being and security.It is typically difficult to understandthe natureof
activists' symbolic goals withoutalso graspingthe materialaspectsof these concerns,In

concerns motivatingthese
Given the mixture of "materialist"and "postmaterialist"
movements, it is thus hardlysurprisingthatall of the "new"movementshave historical
antecedentsin periodsbeforepostmaterialism
is allegedto have become a mass phenomena. To better understandthis point, it is useful to briefly consider the historyof social
movementsin the UnitedStates.Peacemovementshave ebbedand flowedthroughoutthe
20th Century;the upsurgein peace activismin the 1960s and again in the 1980s was far
from unique(Kleidman1993;Wittner1984). "Secondwave"feminismreflectsthe reemergence of women's movementsin the 1960s and 1970s from earliermovementsin the
19th and early 20th Centuries(see e.g., Cott 1987). The environmentalmovementsof
recent decades had precursorsin the conservationistmovementsof earlierperiods.The
powerfulstudentmovementof the 1960s was precededby an importantbut understudied
studentmovementin the 1930s (Cohen 1993).
Inglehart'sattemptsto applyhis theoryto explainingthe new social movementsarethus
as limited as his attemptsto show that a systematicshift in values has taken place in
postindustrialsocieties. Inspectionof the historyof social movementsdemonstratesthatto
emphasize "postmaterialist"values in explaining the new movements is to miss the
importanceof "materialist"values in generatingsupportand motivatingparticipationin
contemporarypoliticalaction. In sum, we gain little explanatorypowerin inferringthata
sea-changein values per se accountsfor the types of politicalchangesthathave appeared
since the 1960s in postindustrialsocieties.

1. Althoughthere are importantdifferencesbetween them, theories of postindustrialsociety
share with new class approachesan emphasison the increasedimportanceof the educatedmiddle
class and their growing capacityto influencepolitical life (Bell 1973; Lipset 1981, pp. 503-523;
Touraine1971; see Bell 1979, however,for a substantialcritiqueof the new class theories).

Szabo 1985; and VanDeth 1983a, 1983b.The Germansocial theoristJurgenHabermas(1987) has
drawnuponInglehart'sworkto characterizethe changingfrontiersof social conflictfromthesphere
"Thisnew type of conflict is an expressionof the 'Silent
of "material"to "cultural"reproduction:
Revolution' in values and attitudesthat accordingto R. Ingleharthas been observed in entire
populations"(1987, p. 392). The batteryof questionsdevelopedby Inglehartto operationalizehis
index havebeen includedin several NationalElectionStudy surveysin
postmaterialist/materialist
the United States, and the batteryhas now been incorporatedinto the InternationalSocial Survey
Program.A numberof usefulcriticaldiscussionsof variousaspectsof Inglehart'sprojecthavealso
appeared.See especially Clarkeand Dutt 1991; Dieter-Opp1990; Flanagan1982, 1987;Hamilton
1987; Hamiltonand Wright 1986; Laffertyand Knutsen 1985; Marsh 1975; Savage 1985; and
Weakliem1991.
3. Inglehart'sindex of valuesdoes allow for a residual"mixed"categoryfor respondentswho
choose one postmaterialistand one materialistgoal, but this categoryplays virtuallyno analytical
role in his research due to his theoreticalfocus on the internally homogeneouscategoriesof
"postmaterialists"and "materialists."One of the log-linear models of the postmaterialistthesis
developed in this paperdoes, however,includea parameterrepresentingrespondentswith"mixed"
values.
4. This 4-item index has been used since Inglehart'sorigional 1970 EuropeanCommunities
in his 1990 work CultureShift(suchas the
Study:virtuallyall of the datatablesandinterpretations
calculatedproportionof postmaterialists
by countryand by year) are basedon the 4-item index(see
Inglehart1990a, pp. 7, 85, 91, 93 and passim).
5. It is because these threecategoriesare orderedwith respect to the degree of respondents'
thattheycan be said to exemplify a unidimensionalscale (ratherthan
supportfor "postmaterialsim"
an index of nominalcategories).
6. An importantstrandof researchon mass publicopinion thatanticipatesthe relevanceof the
idea of value pluralismcan be foundin Sniderman'srecentwork (1993; cf. Sniderman,Brody,and
Tetlock 1991).
7. The PoliticalAction surveyswerecarriedout in eight countries(Britain,WestGermany,the
Netherlands,Austria,the UnitedStates, Italy,Switzerland,and Finland)at the survey'sfirstcrosssection, and repeatedin threecountries(WestGermany,the Netherlands,and the UnitedStates)at
the survey's second cross-section.
8. In other words, any effects of a particularbiased item - such as Inglehart's"maintaining
order"indicatorof "materialism- will be much largerin Inglehart'sfour-itembattery(for which
optionsto count as a materialist)thanin the eight-item
respondentsmust choose both"materialist"

and
9. The possibilitythatrespondentsmay choose to simultaneouslyasserttwo postmaterialist
two materialistvalues is logicallyprecludedby analyzingfour items drawnfromthe samebattery.

565

This is because if the four items (two materialist,two postmaterialist)were drawnfrom the same
battery,it would-by construction-rule out the possibility that respondentsmight rate all four
values as important(becauserespondentscan select only threepossibleprioritiesfor each battery).
10. Among the firstbatteryof items, one conflatesmaterialismwith authoritarianism
("make
sure thatthis countryhas strongdefense forces")and anothertaps an issue which is clearly not as
centralto postmaterialistvalues("tryto makeourcities andcountrysidemorebeautiful").Twoitems
tap into a centralelementof materialism(economicprosperity)butare similarenoughin contentto
be redundant.
11. The threepostmaterialist
itemsreferenceconcernswith self-determination,
a "less impersonal" society, and "a society whereideasaremoreimportantthanmoney."The two materialistitems
referencesconcernswith aboutcrime and economic security.
12. Among this second set of items, two of the twelve referenceends whose relevance for
materialistvalues is questionable("Thefight againstrising prices"and "ensurling]the supply of
energy"). A third is focussedprimarilyon a policy ratherthan a value ("providinggood medical
care");a fourthis virtuallyidenticalto the "fightingcrime"item fromthe firstbattery("Guaranteeing good neighborhoodssafe fromcrime");anda fifthraisesa concern("providinggood education")
which is ambiguousfrom the standpointof the postmaterialist/materialist
distinction.
13. Underthese conditions,weightingthe databecomesnecessaryto even allow the algorithm
for fittingthe models to converge.However,becauseof the table'slargedimensions,we foundthat
this resultedin an extremebias towardsequiprobability(i.e., any model includinga grandmean
effect fit well, therebyrenderinghypothesistesting meaningless).
14. The second cross-sectionof the WestGermansurveydid not field eitherof the two batteries
of value priorityitems and thus cannotbe used in the over-timeanalysis.
15. The two WestGermancohortsarerespondents29 andyoungerversusthose 30 andover in
1974-1975.

16. In this paper,we use the terms"latentclasses" and "latentcategories"synonymously.
17. As discussedin precedingsectionsof the paper,the theoreticalassumptionsof discreteand
internallyhomogeneouscategoriesare criticalto the logic of the postmaterialistthesis: Inglehart
assumes not only that "postmaterialism"
and "materialism"representdiscrete categories on a
unidimensionalscale, butthatwithinthesecategoriesthe probabilityof rankingpostmaterialistand
materialistitems in the expected way is equivalentto 1.0. Withoutthese assumptionsit is not
possible to infer that survey responsesto questions about value prioritiesare indicativeof two
discrete categoriesof values.
18. In Duncan'soriginalformulation(1979), the two-waymarginaleffect parametersrepresent
randomeffects andthe modelincludingtheseterms(andtermsfor theone-waymarginals)is simply
a convenientbase model for testing for the presenceof responseconsistency.
19. Model 4 is Duncan'sfull model of responseconsistencyappliedto the case of four value
priorityitems. As Duncandemonstrates(1979), the inclusionof the parametersfor pairwiseitem
associationin this model entails thatcalculationsof the proportionof respondentswithin the two
latentcategoriesmust take into accountestimatesof pairwiseassociation.The estimationof latent
category proportionsdo not, however-in view of the actual modeling results-figure in the
analyses developed in this paper.
20. Note thatdegreesof freedomfor the models fittedto datafor the old cohortin 1973 depart
from expectedbecauseof a samplingzero in the table thatappliesto the "materialist"
cell (1100).
For this reason, the two models representingthe postmaterialistthesis have two fewer degrees of
freedomthanwould be expected.Modelcomparisonsunderthese conditionstake into accountthe
actualdegreesof freedomfor a givenmodel.To insurethatthe samplingzero in this table(as well as
in subsequenttables with samplingzeros)had no effect on statisticalinferenceandpreferredmodel
choice, we re-analyzedthe datausing a correctiveweightingscheme. We foundthe resultsfor the
weighteddatato be congruentwiththoseusing the unweighteddata.These tablesareavailableupon
requestfrom the authors.

the
value pluralismthesis) or 2 or 4 (thuscorroboratingthe postmaterialistthesis).
22. We analyzethe relationshipof each of these six items to six correspondingitems from the
Political Action I surveywhich pose the following question:"Tellme how muchresponsibilityyou
think governmenthas for dealing with the problem ... 0. no responsibilityat all; 1. some
responsibility;2. an importantresponsibility;3. an essentialresponsibility?"Forthese analyses,the
six value priorityitems have been coded as follows: 0. absolutelyunimportant;1. not very important;2. important;3. very important.Whileit wouldbe informativeto analyzethe inter-relationship
of the other four postmaterialistand materialistitems from the previous section's analyses, the
batteryfrom which the items are drawnlacks correspondingquestions about the state's responsibility.
23. Inglehartdoes not claim that postmaterialistvalues are the sole explanationfor the new
movements,notingalso that"objectiveproblems,organizations,and ideologieshave beenat work"
as well as "the rising level of politicalskills among mass publics, as educationhas become more
widespreadand political informationmore pervasive"(1990a, p. 372).
